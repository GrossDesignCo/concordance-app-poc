μεγάλους (megalous) - great ones (accusative plural)
- Genesis 1:21: "καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς τὰ κήτη τὰ **μεγάλα**" ("And God made the **great** sea creatures")

μεγάλα (megala) - great things (neuter plural)
- Genesis 1:16: "καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς τοὺς δύο φωστῆρας τοὺς **μεγάλους**" ("And God made the two **great** lights")

In the New Testament, this Greek word family appears in significant contexts:

Luke 1:49 "For he who is mighty has done **great** (μεγάλα, megala) things for me, and holy is his name."

## Patterns

### Creation Hierarchy Pattern

In Genesis 1, הַגְּדֹלִ֑ים establishes a pattern of hierarchical ordering within creation:

Genesis 1:16 "God made **the-greats lights**—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night."
- Creates distinction between greater and lesser lights
- Establishes governance roles based on relative greatness
- Shows divine intentionality in ordering creation

Genesis 1:21 "So God created **the-greats sea creatures** and every living creature that moves..."
- Distinguishes special category of sea creatures
- Parallels the lights pattern, showing consistent creative ordering
- Demonstrates God's authority over even the most imposing creatures

This pattern reveals that greatness in biblical creation is:
1. Divinely established (not self-claimed)
2. Purposeful (tied to specific roles)
3. Relational (defined in comparison to others)
4. Hierarchical (creating order, not equality)

### Divine Attribute Pattern

הַגָּדוֹל (singular form) appears repeatedly as a divine attribute, creating a theological pattern:

Deuteronomy 10:17 "For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, **the-great**, **the-great** God, mighty and awesome..."

Psalm 77:13 "What god is **great** like our God?"

Jeremiah 32:18 "O **great** and mighty God, whose name is the LORD of hosts..."

Malachi 1:11 "For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name will be **great** among the nations..."

This pattern establishes that:
1. Greatness is fundamental to God's nature
2. Divine greatness encompasses power, authority, and significance
3. God's greatness is incomparable to any other being
4. Recognition of God's greatness is proper response to revelation

### Kingship Pattern

The concept of greatness appears consistently in royal contexts:

1 Kings 10:23 "Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom."

2 Chronicles 2:5 "The house that I am to build will be **great**, for our God is **greater** than all gods."

Psalm 47:2 "For the LORD, the Most High, is to be feared, a **great** king over all the earth."

Psalm 95:3 "For the LORD is a **great** God, and a **great** King above all gods."

This pattern reveals:
1. Greatness as a royal attribute
2. Comparison as a means of establishing relative greatness
3. God as the ultimate standard of royal greatness
4. Human kingship as derivative of divine greatness

### Reversal Pattern

Scripture presents a distinctive pattern where conventional greatness is reversed:

1 Samuel 5:9 "And the hand of the LORD was against the city, causing a very **great** panic, and he afflicted the men of the city, both young and old..."

Proverbs 25:6 "Do not put yourself forward in the king's presence or stand in the place of the **great**."

Isaiah 5:9 "The LORD of hosts has sworn in my hearing: Surely many houses shall be desolate, **great** and beautiful houses, without inhabitant."

Mark 10:43 "But whoever would be **great** among you must be your servant."

This pattern shows:
1. Human greatness is temporary
2. Self-claimed greatness leads to downfall
3. True greatness often manifests in service
4. Divine judgment can target what humans consider great

## Cultural Context

### Greatness in Ancient Near Eastern Society

In ancient Near Eastern cultures, greatness was a multifaceted concept deeply embedded in social, political, and religious structures:

#### Social Dimensions

For ancient Israelites, greatness (גְּדֹלִ֑ים) carried immediate associations with:

- **Age and Eldership**: The "great ones" often referred to elders whose age granted them authority and wisdom. When Israelites heard "the greats," they would think of respected elders sitting at the city gate rendering judgments.

- **Family Position**: Firstborn sons were called "great" (gadol) compared to younger siblings, reflecting inheritance rights and family leadership responsibilities.

- **Wealth Indicators**: Large flocks, numerous servants, and extensive lands marked someone as "great" in community standing.

#### Political Realities

The political dimension of greatness would evoke:

- **Imperial Powers**: Israel existed in the shadow of "great kings" of Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, and Persia. These empires were literally called "the greats" in diplomatic correspondence.

- **Military Might**: Greatness correlated directly with military capability. The "great" nations possessed chariots, fortified cities, and standing armies.

- **Monumental Architecture**: Great kings demonstrated greatness through massive building projects. Solomon's temple established Israel's king among "the greats."

#### Religious Understanding

In religious contexts, greatness carried specific connotations:

- **Divine Attributes**: Unlike pagan deities associated with specific domains, YHWH's greatness was comprehensive—spanning creation, history, and ethics.

- **Sacrificial System**: "Great" offerings required more resources and demonstrated higher status. The distinction between "greater" and "lesser" offerings was codified in ritual law.

- **Cosmic Order**: The "great lights" of Genesis 1 reflected the ordered cosmos where everything had its proper place and function in a divinely established hierarchy.

### Ancient vs. Modern Understanding

Modern readers often misunderstand הַגְּדֹלִ֑ים (haGdolim) in several ways:

1. **Size vs. Significance**: While modern English "great" can indicate mere size, ancient Hebrew גָּדוֹל consistently connected physical size with significance, authority, and power.

2. **Subjective vs. Objective**: Today, "greatness" often suggests subjective evaluation. In biblical Hebrew, greatness typically indicated objective status within a divinely established order.

3. **Achievement vs. Assignment**: Modern concepts of greatness often emphasize personal achievement. Biblical greatness frequently emphasized divinely assigned position and responsibility.

4. **Individual vs. Communal**: Contemporary notions of greatness focus on individual accomplishment. Biblical greatness typically emphasized one's role within community and covenant.

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- Mere physical size
- Personal accomplishment
- Subjective evaluation
- Individual celebrity

Instead, picture:
- A mountain dominating the landscape
- A king whose authority orders society
- A cornerstone determining a building's structure
- A patriarch whose decisions shape generations

The biblical concept of "the-greats" establishes both identity and responsibility within a divinely ordered world.
