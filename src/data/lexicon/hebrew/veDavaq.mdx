## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), דָבַק is primarily translated as:

προσκολλάω (proskollao) - to glue to, join closely

- Genesis 2:24: "Therefore a man... shall be **joined** (προσκολληθήσεται) to his wife"
- This exact term appears in Jesus' teaching on marriage:
- Matthew 19:5: "...and the two shall become one flesh" (quoting Genesis 2:24)
- Mark 10:7: "...and **be joined** to his wife" (also quoting Genesis 2:24)

This New Testament usage shows how the concept of "clinging" extends from physical marriage to spiritual union with Christ.

## Patterns

### Covenant Loyalty Pattern

The most prominent pattern of דָבַק usage involves covenant loyalty to God, appearing repeatedly in Deuteronomy and Joshua:

Deuteronomy 4:4 "But you who **clung** to the LORD your God are all alive today."

Deuteronomy 10:20 "You shall fear the LORD your God... and **cling** to him..."

Deuteronomy 11:22 "...loving the LORD your God, walking in all his ways, and **clinging** to him..."

Deuteronomy 13:4 "You shall walk after the LORD your God and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice, and you shall serve him and **cling** to him."

Deuteronomy 30:20 "...loving the LORD your God, obeying his voice and **clinging** to him, for he is your life and length of days..."

Joshua 22:5 "...to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, and to **cling** to him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."

Joshua 23:8 "But **cling** to the LORD your God just as you have done to this day."

This pattern establishes דָבַק as a key covenant term, describing the ideal relationship between God and Israel. It appears alongside other covenant terms like "love," "fear," "serve," and "obey," but uniquely emphasizes the intimate, permanent nature of the bond.

### Marriage and Union Pattern

The second major pattern connects דָבַק with the marriage relationship, establishing a theological link between human marriage and divine covenant:

Genesis 2:24 "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and **cling** to his wife, and they shall become one flesh."

This foundational usage is quoted by Jesus in:
- Matthew 19:5 "...and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'?"
- Mark 10:7-8 "'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh."

The pattern continues with Ruth's commitment to Naomi:
Ruth 1:14 "...but Ruth **clung** to her."

And in prophetic imagery:
Jeremiah 13:11 "For as the loincloth **clings** to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah **cling** to me, declares the LORD..."

This pattern reveals how marriage serves as a physical embodiment of the covenant relationship between God and his people, with both relationships characterized by the same intense, transformative attachment.

### Consequence Pattern

A third pattern shows דָבַק used for the permanent attachment of consequences to actions:

2 Kings 5:27 "The leprosy of Naaman shall **cling** to you and to your descendants forever."

Psalm 101:3 "I will not set before my eyes anything that is worthless. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not **cling** to me."

Psalm 41:8 "A deadly thing is **poured out** on him; he who is laid in bed will not rise again." (Note: Hebrew uses דָבַק here)

Deuteronomy 28:60 "He will bring upon you again all the diseases of Egypt, of which you were afraid, and they shall **cling** to you."

This pattern demonstrates how the concept of "clinging" extends beyond voluntary relationships to the moral order of the universe, where consequences "cling" to those who trigger them.

## Cultural Context

### Agricultural Imagery

For ancient Israelites living in an agricultural society, the concept of דָבַק would evoke familiar physical experiences:

- Burrs and thorns that attached to clothing during fieldwork
- Grafting branches that permanently joined to trees
- Clay that stuck to the potter's hands
- Bread dough that adhered to the kneading bowl

These everyday experiences provided concrete images for understanding both the physical and metaphorical uses of דָבַק.

### Ancient Marriage Practices

The use of דָבַק in Genesis 2:24 must be understood within ancient Near Eastern marriage customs:

- Marriage often involved the groom physically moving from his father's household
- The bride typically joined the husband's family compound
- The Hebrew term emphasizes the permanence of this new family unit
- Unlike surrounding cultures where divorce was relatively simple, the biblical ideal stressed permanent union

When Moses wrote "a man shall leave his father and mother and **cling** to his wife," he was establishing a counter-cultural view of marriage that emphasized permanence and exclusivity.

### Covenant Language

In the ancient Near East, treaties and covenants used specific language to describe loyalty between parties:

- Vassal treaties required subjects to "cling" to their sovereign
- Loyalty was described in terms of physical attachment
- Breaking such bonds was considered a serious breach

When Deuteronomy repeatedly commands Israel to "cling" to God, it employs familiar covenant language that would have resonated with ancient hearers as a call to exclusive loyalty.

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- Temporary attachment
- Emotional neediness
- Unhealthy dependence
- Simple physical contact

Instead, picture:
- Two pieces of wood glued together so thoroughly they cannot be separated without damage
- A vine that has grown so intertwined with a tree that they function as one organism
- A commitment so complete that individual identity merges into a new, unified whole

The Hebrew concept of דָבַק involves transformation through attachment—not just touching but becoming united in purpose, identity, and destiny.
