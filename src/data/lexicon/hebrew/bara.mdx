# **בָּרָ֣א (Bara, created)**

Picture a divine craftsman bringing into existence something that wasn't there before—not by assembling pre-existing materials, but through the power of intention and word. This is creation that transcends human capability, bringing forth something fundamentally new.

## **Root**

ב-ר-א (b-r-a) To create

Closest English mapping: "created", indicating divine origination of something previously non-existent.

Verb class: Qal form, though appears in Niphal (passive) and Piel (intensive) forms as well

## **In-Context**

Bara is distinguished by its exclusive use with God as the subject (except in one specialized case in Joshua 17:15, where it refers to clearing forest land).

Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God **created** the heavens and the earth.

Genesis 1:27 So God **created** mankind in his own image, in the image of God he **created** them; male and female he **created** them.

Genesis 2:3 Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of **creating** that he had done.

Isaiah 45:7 I form light and **create** darkness; I make well-being and **create** calamity; I am the LORD, who does all these things.

Isaiah 65:17 For behold, I **create** new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind.

Psalm 51:10 **Create** in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.

## **Biblical Patterns**

### **The Creation-Covenant Pattern**

Bara appears at pivotal moments in Scripture where God establishes new covenant relationships:

1. **Initial Creation** (Genesis 1)
   - Creation of cosmos and humanity
   - Establishes God's relationship with creation
   - Sets pattern for all subsequent "creations"

2. **Post-Flood Renewal** (Genesis 9)
   - Command to "be fruitful and multiply" echoes Genesis 1
   - Though bara isn't used, the renewal parallels original creation

3. **Patriarchal Promise** (Isaiah 43:1-7)
   - "But now, thus says the LORD, who **created** you, O Jacob"
   - Links Israel's formation to original creation
   - Establishes covenant identity

4. **Exodus and Sinai** (Exodus 34:10)
   - "I will do marvels... that have not been **created** (נִבְרְא֥וּ)"
   - New creation of Israel as covenant people

5. **Davidic Covenant** (Psalm 51:10)
   - David prays "**Create** in me a clean heart"
   - Personal renewal through divine creation

6. **New Covenant** (Isaiah 65:17-18)
   - "I **create** new heavens and a new earth"
   - Ultimate renewal of creation and covenant

7. **New Testament Fulfillment** (2 Corinthians 5:17)
   - "If anyone is in Christ, new creation"
   - Completes the pattern in Christ

This pattern reveals how bara connects God's original creative work with His ongoing covenant relationship with His people.

### **The Word-Creation Pattern**

A distinctive pattern emerges in how bara relates to divine speech:

1. **Creation by Word** (Genesis 1)
   - "God said... and it was so"
   - Bara accomplished through divine speech
   - No struggle or effort implied

2. **Prophetic Announcement** (Isaiah 45:7-8)
   - "I **create** (בּוֹרֵ֥א) evil... I the LORD do all these things"
   - Divine speech declaring creative action

3. **Performative Commands** (Numbers 16:30)
   - "If the LORD **creates** (יִבְרָ֣א) a creation (בְּרִיאָ֞ה)"
   - Speech that brings about the described reality

4. **New Creation Proclamation** (Isaiah 65:17)
   - "I **create** (בוֹרֵ֛א) new heavens and a new earth"
   - Divine declaration that accomplishes what it announces

5. **New Testament Fulfillment** (John 1:1-3)
   - "In the beginning was the Word... all things were made through him"
   - Christ as the creative Word incarnate

This pattern shows how bara is intimately connected with God's spoken word—creation happens when God speaks.

### **The Triad Creation Pattern**

In Genesis 1, bara appears at three critical junctures, marking the creation of three fundamental categories of existence:

1. **Cosmic Creation** (Genesis 1:1)
   - "In the beginning God **created** the heavens and the earth"
   - Establishes the universe itself

2. **Animal Life** (Genesis 1:21)
   - "So God **created** the great sea creatures and every living creature"
   - Marks transition to conscious life

3. **Human Life** (Genesis 1:27)
   - "So God **created** man in his own image"
   - Triple use of bara emphasizes humanity's special status

This pattern suggests that bara marks particularly significant creative acts that establish new categories of existence, not merely modifications of existing things.

## **Cultural Context**

### **Ancient Near Eastern Creation Concepts**

Unlike other ancient Near Eastern creation accounts, the biblical concept of bara has several distinctive features:

1. **Creation Without Conflict**
   - Mesopotamian accounts: Creation through divine combat
   - Egyptian accounts: Creation from primordial gods
   - Biblical account: Creation through peaceful divine command
   - Bara implies effortless divine authority

2. **Creation Without Pre-existing Material**
   - Other ANE accounts: Gods shape existing matter
   - Biblical account: God brings matter into existence
   - Bara suggests creation that transcends natural processes

3. **Creation by a Single Deity**
   - Other ANE accounts: Multiple deities involved
   - Biblical account: One God creates all
   - Bara exclusively used with YHWH as subject

4. **Creation with Purpose**
   - Other ANE accounts: Humans created as divine afterthought
   - Biblical account: Humans as pinnacle of creation
   - Bara of humans receives special emphasis

### **Hebrew Thought Patterns**

For ancient Hebrew readers, bara would have carried several important connotations:

1. **Divine Prerogative**
   - Only God can truly create (bara)
   - Humans can make (asah) but not create
   - Establishes fundamental Creator-creature distinction

2. **Order from Disorder**
   - Creation as organizing principle
   - Bara brings form to formlessness
   - Establishes proper boundaries and relationships

3. **Newness and Renewal**
   - Not just first creation but ongoing renewal
   - Basis for hope in God's restorative power
   - Personal and cosmic applications

4. **Creation and Covenant**
   - Creation establishes relationship
   - Divine ownership through creation
   - Basis for God's authority and care

### **Reading Note for English Readers**

Modern readers might think of:
- Manufacturing or assembling
- Artistic expression
- Innovation or invention
- Evolution or development

Instead, picture:
- Speaking something into existence from nothing
- Establishing an entirely new category of being
- Effortlessly bringing forth what could not exist naturally
- Originating not just form but substance

The word bara carries a sense of divine prerogative and absolute origination that transcends human creative capacity—it's not just making something new, but bringing into existence what could not otherwise be.
