# תַּאֲוָה (Taavah, desirable)

Picture a magnetic pull drawing you toward something beautiful—not just an idle wish, but a powerful attraction that moves you to action. This is תַּאֲוָה (taavah), the force that makes something not merely wanted but irresistibly desirable.

The root conveys intense longing or craving, often with physical or emotional intensity.

Closest English mapping: "desirable" - indicating something that provokes strong desire or longing.

## In-Context

Genesis 3:6 "When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a **desirable** thing for the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate."

Numbers 11:4 "The mixed multitude that was among them fell to craving. The children of Israel also wept again, and said, 'Who will give us meat to eat? We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; but now our soul is dried away. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at.' The manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium. The people went around, gathered it, ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil. When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it. Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and Yahweh's anger burned greatly; and Moses was displeased. Moses said to Yahweh, 'Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why haven't I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me? Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them out, that you should tell me, "Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers"? Where could I get meat to give all these people? For they weep before me, saying, "Give us meat, that we may eat." I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. If you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found favor in your sight; and don't let me see my wretchedness.' Yahweh said to Moses, 'Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you. I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you don't bear it yourself alone. Say to the people, "Sanctify yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, and you will eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, 'Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt.' Therefore Yahweh will give you meat, and you will eat. You will not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because you have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, 'Why did we come out of Egypt?'"' Moses said, 'The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, "I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month." Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?' Yahweh said to Moses, 'Has Yahweh's hand grown short? Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not.' Moses went out, and told the people Yahweh's words; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent. Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more. But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the Spirit rested on them. They were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, 'Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!' Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, 'My lord Moses, forbid them!' Moses said to him, 'Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all Yahweh's people were prophets, that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them!' Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. A wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth. The people rose up all that day, and all of that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers; and they spread them all out for themselves around the camp. While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, Yahweh's anger burned against the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague. The name of that place was called Kibroth haTaavah, because there they buried the people who had the **desirable** craving."

Psalm 10:3 "For the wicked boasts of his heart's **desirable** things. He blesses the greedy and condemns Yahweh."

Psalm 21:2 "You have given him his heart's **desirable** thing, and have not withheld the request of his lips."

Proverbs 10:24 "What the wicked fear will overtake them, but the **desirable** thing of the righteous will be granted."

Proverbs 11:23 "The **desirable** thing of the righteous is only good. The expectation of the wicked is wrath."

Proverbs 13:12 "Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when **desirable** things come, it is a tree of life."

Proverbs 19:22 "That which makes a man to be **desirable** is his kindness. A poor man is better than a liar."

Proverbs 21:20 "There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man swallows it up. He who follows after righteousness and kindness finds life, righteousness, and honor. A wise man scales the city of the mighty, and brings down the strength of its confidence. Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles. The proud and arrogant man—"Scoffer" is his name— he works in the arrogance of pride. The **desirable** things of the sluggard kill him, for his hands refuse to labor."

Isaiah 26:8 "Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, we have waited for you. Your name and your renown are the **desirable** thing of our soul."

## Patterns

### The Desire Cycle

Scripture presents a recurring pattern showing how desire operates in human experience:

1. **Seeing** - Visual stimulus triggers desire
   - Genesis 3:6 "When the woman **saw** that the tree was good for food, and that it was a **desirable** thing for the eyes..."
   - Joshua 7:21 "When I **saw** among the spoil a beautiful cloak... then I **coveted** them and took them."

2. **Desiring** - Internal response of longing
   - Psalm 21:2 "You have given him his heart's **desirable** thing"
   - Proverbs 13:12 "Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when **desirable** things come, it is a tree of life."

3. **Acting** - Behavior following desire
   - Genesis 3:6 "...she took of its fruit and ate."
   - Numbers 11:4-34 Israel's craving led to gathering quail

4. **Consequences** - Results of desire-driven actions
   - Genesis 3:16-19 Pain, toil, and death follow forbidden fruit
   - Numbers 11:33 "While the meat was still between their teeth... Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague."
   - Proverbs 13:12 Fulfilled desire becomes "a tree of life"

This pattern appears consistently whether desire leads to blessing or judgment, showing that desire itself is morally neutral—its object and governance determine outcomes.

### The Two Paths of Desire

Scripture presents two distinct trajectories for human desire:

#### Righteous Desire

- **Object**: God and His ways
  - Psalm 73:25 "Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you."
  - Isaiah 26:8 "Your name and your renown are the **desirable** thing of our soul."

- **Character**: Patient, submitted to God
  - Psalm 37:4 "Delight yourself in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart."
  - Proverbs 11:23 "The **desirable** thing of the righteous is only good."

- **Outcome**: Fulfillment and life
  - Proverbs 13:12 "When **desirable** things come, it is a tree of life."
  - Psalm 21:2 "You have given him his heart's **desirable** thing."

#### Wayward Desire

- **Object**: Created things apart from Creator
  - Numbers 11:4 "The mixed multitude... fell to craving."
  - Psalm 10:3 "The wicked boasts of his heart's **desirable** things."

- **Character**: Impatient, autonomous
  - Numbers 11:4-10 Israel weeping for meat despite God's provision
  - Proverbs 21:25-26 "The **desirable** things of the sluggard kill him."

- **Outcome**: Judgment and death
  - Numbers 11:33-34 "Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague."
  - James 1:15 "Desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death."

This pattern reveals that desire itself isn't condemned—rather, its direction and governance determine whether it leads to blessing or judgment.

## Cultural Context

### Agricultural Imagery

For ancient Israelites living in an agricultural society, desire was understood through tangible experiences:

- **Hunger and Thirst**: Physical cravings were daily realities in a subsistence economy
  - Numbers 11:4-6 Israel's craving for Egypt's food variety
  - Deuteronomy 12:20 Regulations for meat consumption based on "soul's desire"

- **Harvest Anticipation**: The long wait between planting and harvest shaped understanding of deferred desire
  - Proverbs 13:12 "Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when **desirable** things come, it is a tree of life."
  - James 5:7 "See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it..."

- **Firstfruits**: The practice of offering first portions taught desire management
  - Proverbs 3:9 "Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce"
  - This practice acknowledged God's primacy over natural desires

### Ancient Near Eastern Context

Israel's understanding of desire contrasted with surrounding cultures:

- **Egyptian Afterlife**: Focused on satisfying desires in the next life through elaborate burial preparations
  - Tomb paintings often depicted desired foods, activities
  - Contrasts with Israel's focus on present faithfulness

- **Canaanite Fertility Cults**: Ritualized desire through sacred prostitution
  - Hosea critiques Israel's adoption of these practices
  - Biblical law prohibited ritual prostitution (Deuteronomy 23:17-18)

- **Mesopotamian Epics**: Often featured desire-driven quests
  - Gilgamesh's desire for immortality
  - Contrasts with biblical emphasis on desire for God's ways

### Social Structures

Desire was regulated through communal practices:

- **Jubilee Laws**: Prevented unlimited acquisition
  - Leviticus 25 established property return cycles
  - Limited how far desire for wealth could be pursued

- **Gleaning Rights**: Ensured desire for efficiency didn't override compassion
  - Ruth 2 shows gleaning in practice
  - Leviticus 19:9-10 established these rights

- **Sabbath**: Regular rest disciplined economic desires
  - Exodus 20:8-11 commanded work cessation
  - Prevented desire for productivity from becoming all-consuming

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- Consumer desire triggered by advertising
- Individualistic pursuit of personal desires
- Desire as primarily sexual or materialistic
- "Follow your heart" as unquestioned wisdom

Instead, picture:
- A farmer watching crops daily, longing for rain
- A community whose desires are shaped by covenant
- Desire as a powerful force requiring wise governance
- The magnetic pull toward what truly satisfies the soul

The Hebrew understanding of תַּאֲוָה reminds us that desire itself isn't condemned—rather, its direction and governance determine whether it leads to blessing or judgment. The biblical vision isn't desire's elimination but its proper orientation toward God and neighbor.
