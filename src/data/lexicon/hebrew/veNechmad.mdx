## In-Context

Genesis 2:9 "And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight **and-coveted** for food."

Genesis 3:6 "So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, **and-coveted** to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate."

Psalm 19:10 "More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb." (Here נֶחְמָדִים appears without the prefix, as "**coveted**")

Ezekiel 23:6 "who were clothed in purple, governors and commanders, all of them **coveted** young men, horsemen riding on horses." (Again without the prefix)

Psalm 39:11 "When you discipline a man with rebukes for sin, you consume like a moth what is **coveted** by him." (Without the prefix)

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), נֶחְמָד is primarily translated as:

Genesis 2:9: ὡραῖον (hōraion) - "beautiful/timely"
- From ὥρα (hōra), meaning "the right time/season"
- Suggests something beautiful in its prime
- Matthew 23:27 uses this word for whitewashed tombs that appear "beautiful" outwardly

Genesis 3:6: ὡραῖόν (hōraion) - "beautiful/timely"
- Same word as above
- Maintains the aesthetic aspect of desirability

Psalm 19:10 (18:11 LXX): ἐπιθυμητά (epithymēta) - "desirable things"
- From ἐπιθυμέω (epithymeō), "to set one's heart upon"
- This Greek root appears in the tenth commandment (Exodus 20:17 LXX)
- Jesus uses this word family in Matthew 5:28 regarding lustful desire

The Greek translation shows how the concept bridges both aesthetic beauty (ὡραῖον) and powerful desire (ἐπιθυμητά), reflecting the dual nature of the Hebrew term.

## Patterns

### The Garden Pattern

The word נֶחְמָד plays a crucial role in the Garden of Eden narrative, appearing at two pivotal moments:

1. **Creation**: Genesis 2:9 - God makes trees "**coveted** for food"
   - Establishes God as the creator of legitimate desire
   - Shows divine provision of what humans naturally desire
   - Sets up the goodness of creation and its appeal

2. **Temptation**: Genesis 3:6 - Eve sees the tree is "**coveted** to make one wise"
   - Reveals how legitimate desire can be misdirected
   - Shows the serpent exploiting the natural human response to what is coveted
   - Demonstrates how desirability can lead to disobedience

This pattern reveals a theological tension: the same quality (being coveted/desirable) appears in both God's good provision and in the forbidden fruit. This suggests that desire itself isn't the problem, but rather its direction and boundaries.

### The Commandment Connection

A significant pattern emerges when we connect נֶחְמָד with the tenth commandment:

Exodus 20:17 "You shall not **covet** (תַחְמֹד) your neighbor's house..."

- Same root (ח-מ-ד) as נֶחְמָד but in verbal form
- Creates a theological link between:
  - What is naturally desirable (נֶחְמָד)
  - The act of desiring inappropriately (חָמַד)

This pattern appears in several passages:

Psalm 19:10 - God's laws are "more **coveted** (נֶחְמָדִים) than gold"
- Redirects desire toward proper objects
- Establishes God's word as the ultimate desirable thing

Proverbs 21:20 - "**Coveted** (נֶחְמָד) treasure and oil are in the dwelling of the wise"
- Links wisdom with properly directed desire
- Contrasts with foolish consumption

This pattern shows how Scripture doesn't condemn desire itself but redirects it toward proper objects and boundaries.

## Cultural Context

### Agricultural Significance

For ancient Israelites living in an agricultural society, the concept of something being נֶחְמָד (coveted) would have immediate practical significance:

- **Food Security**: In Genesis 2:9, trees "coveted for food" would represent not just aesthetic pleasure but survival and prosperity. In a subsistence farming culture, desirable food-bearing plants were literally life-sustaining.

- **First Fruits**: The most "coveted" portions of crops and flocks were designated for sacrifice, establishing a connection between desirability and worship.

- **Land Inheritance**: The prohibition against coveting in the tenth commandment would have particular resonance in an agricultural society where land represented both identity and livelihood.

### Visual Culture and Desire

Unlike our image-saturated modern world, the ancient Near Eastern visual landscape was more limited:

- **Rarity Creates Desire**: Beautiful objects, vibrant colors, and unusual materials would have been rarer and thus more intensely coveted when encountered.

- **Temple Aesthetics**: The elaborate beauty of the tabernacle and temple deliberately employed "coveted" materials and craftsmanship to direct desire toward worship.

- **Status Symbols**: Items described as נֶחְמָד often represented not just beauty but social standing and divine blessing.

### Wisdom Tradition

The use of נֶחְמָד in wisdom literature reveals how the concept functioned in Israel's intellectual tradition:

- **Personified Wisdom**: Proverbs presents wisdom itself as something "coveted," more valuable than jewels (Proverbs 8:11).

- **Right Desire**: The wisdom tradition frequently contrasts proper desire (for wisdom, understanding, and God's ways) with improper desire (for wealth, power, or forbidden pleasures).

- **Discernment**: Being able to recognize what is truly "coveted" versus what merely appears so was a central aspect of wisdom teaching.

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- Casual "wanting" or "liking"
- Materialistic consumer desire
- Forbidden or illicit longing
- Superficial aesthetic appeal

Instead, picture:
- The farmer's deep appreciation for rain after drought
- A parent's profound desire for their child's wellbeing
- The natural attraction to something genuinely beautiful and good
- The magnetic pull of something that promises to fulfill a deep need

The Hebrew נֶחְמָד encompasses both the object's inherent quality and the natural human response to that quality—a response that can be either properly directed within God's boundaries or improperly directed beyond them.
