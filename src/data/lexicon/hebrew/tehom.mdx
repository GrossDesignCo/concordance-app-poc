# תְּהוֹם (Tehom, abyss)

Picture an unfathomable depth of dark waters stretching beyond sight and comprehension—a primordial deep that existed before creation was ordered, containing both terrifying power and mysterious potential.

## Root

ת-ה-מ (t-h-m) - Deep waters, primordial depth

Closest English mapping: "abyss", indicating waters of immeasurable depth with connotations of both primeval origin and potential danger.

## Patterns

### Creation-Flood-Exodus Pattern

Tehom appears at pivotal moments in Israel's foundational narratives, forming a theological pattern connecting creation, judgment, and redemption:

#### Creation

Genesis 1:2 "Darkness was over the face of the **abyss**"
- The abyss represents the pre-ordered state
- God's wind/spirit hovers over it, preparing for creative word
- Not portrayed as evil but as raw material awaiting divine ordering

#### Flood

Genesis 7:11 "All the fountains of the great **abyss** burst forth"
- The abyss "returns" in judgment
- Reverses the separation of waters in creation
- Represents uncreation through return to chaotic state

#### Exodus

Exodus 15:5, 8 "The **abysses** covered them... the **abysses** congealed in the heart of the sea"
- The sea becomes an instrument of judgment against Egypt
- Echoes both creation (God controls waters) and flood (waters judge)
- Israel passes through safely as waters are restrained

This pattern shows tehom as both threat and potential, controlled entirely by divine command for purposes of both judgment and salvation.

### Wisdom and the Abyss

A distinct pattern emerges connecting tehom with divine wisdom:

Proverbs 8:27-28 "When he established the heavens, I [Wisdom] was there... when he made firm the **abysses** below"
- Wisdom present at creation's ordering of the abyss
- Suggests wisdom's role in bringing order from chaos

Job 28:14 "The **abyss** says, 'It is not in me,' and the sea says, 'It is not with me'" (speaking of wisdom)
- The abyss cannot contain or comprehend wisdom
- Creates contrast between physical depth and spiritual wisdom

Job 38:16 "Have you entered into the springs of the sea, or walked in the recesses of the **abyss**?"
- God's rhetorical questions to Job include mastery of the abyss
- Links divine wisdom with control over primordial depths

This pattern presents tehom as a counterpoint to wisdom—while the abyss represents unfathomable physical depth, wisdom represents unfathomable divine understanding.

### Tehom as Divine Instrument

Throughout Scripture, the abyss appears as a tool in God's hands:

#### For Judgment

Genesis 7:11 "All the fountains of the great **abyss** burst forth" (flood)
Exodus 15:5 "The **abysses** covered them" (Egyptian army)
Psalm 106:9 "He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry; he led them through the **abyss** as through a desert"

#### For Blessing

Deuteronomy 8:7 "A land of fountains and **abysses** that spring out in valleys and hills"
Ezekiel 31:4 "The **abyss** made it grow tall" (describing a majestic tree)
Psalm 78:15 "He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the **abyss**"

#### For Praise

Psalm 148:7 "Praise Iam from the earth, you sea monsters and all **abysses**"
Psalm 33:7 "He gathers the waters of the sea as a heap; he puts the **abysses** in storehouses"

This pattern reveals tehom not as an independent force but as completely subject to divine command, used for multiple purposes within God's sovereign plan.

### Personal Distress and Deliverance

Tehom frequently appears in poetic passages describing overwhelming personal distress and divine rescue:

Psalm 42:7 "**Abyss** calls to **abyss** at the roar of your waterfalls; all your breakers and waves have gone over me"
- Expresses overwhelming sorrow
- Uses abyss imagery for emotional depths

Psalm 71:20 "You who have made me see many troubles and calamities will revive me again; from the **abysses** of the earth you will bring me up again"
- Contrasts depths of trouble with divine restoration
- Suggests resurrection imagery

Jonah 2:5-6 "The **abyss** surrounded me... yet you brought up my life from the pit"
- Literal sea experience with spiritual significance
- Foreshadows Christ's death and resurrection

This pattern transforms the cosmic abyss into a metaphor for human suffering and divine deliverance, connecting personal experience to cosmic realities.

## Cultural Context

### Ancient Near Eastern Parallels

The Hebrew tehom has connections to other ancient Near Eastern concepts, yet with significant theological differences:

Babylonian Tiamat - primordial saltwater goddess who battles Marduk
- Unlike Tiamat, biblical tehom is never personified or deified
- No battle narrative in Genesis; God simply speaks over the abyss
- Tehom is created, not a competing divine power

Egyptian Nun - primeval waters from which creation emerged
- Similar concept of waters preceding ordered creation
- But Nun remained a deity in Egyptian thought
- Biblical tehom is merely an element of creation, not divine

Canaanite Yamm - sea deity who battles Baal
- Hebrew yam (sea) and tehom overlap but remain distinct
- No battle narrative in Genesis creation
- Tehom is controlled by divine command, not combat

These contrasts reveal the biblical tehom as deliberately demythologized—a powerful created reality rather than a competing deity.

### Geographic and Hydrological Context

For ancient Israelites, several geographic realities informed their understanding of tehom:

#### Mediterranean Sea

- Vast and seemingly bottomless
- Source of both life (fish, trade) and danger (storms)
- Western boundary of their world

#### Dead Sea

- Extremely deep (1,400 feet)
- Sits at lowest point on earth (1,400 feet below sea level)
- Mysterious, lifeless waters

#### Springs and Flash Floods

- Underground water sources suddenly appearing
- Wadis (dry riverbeds) flooding without warning
- Suggested connections between underground waters and surface world

#### Water Cisterns

- Deep, dark water storage
- Essential for survival
- Dangerous if one fell in

These geographic features made tehom both mysterious and practical—a cosmic concept with everyday implications.

### Cosmological Understanding

The ancient Hebrew cosmology pictured:

- Waters above (held back by the firmament)
- Waters below (the abyss/tehom)
- Earth as a flat disk established over these waters
- The abyss as source of springs, wells, and seas

This cosmology appears in passages like:

Psalm 24:2 "He has founded it [the earth] upon the seas and established it upon the rivers"
Psalm 136:6 "To him who spread out the earth above the waters"
Genesis 49:25 "Blessings of the **abyss** that crouches beneath"

For ancient readers, tehom wasn't abstract but represented the literal cosmic waters beneath their feet—waters that could emerge through springs, wells, and floods.

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- A simple hole or pit
- Empty space
- Abstract concept of depth
- Geological feature

Instead, picture:
- Primordial waters existing before creation was ordered
- Cosmic ocean beneath the earth's surface
- Source of all springs, rivers, and seas
- Waters held back only by divine command
- Realm containing both danger and blessing

The abyss in Hebrew thought wasn't empty but full—full of chaotic waters with both destructive potential and life-giving possibilities, entirely under God's sovereign control.
