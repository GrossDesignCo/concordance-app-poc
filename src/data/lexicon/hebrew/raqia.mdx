# רָקִיעַ (Raqia, a hammering-out)

Picture a vast, dome-like structure stretched out above you—not a rigid dome of metal, but a magnificent tent-like covering that separates waters above from waters below, creating a protected space where life can flourish. Like the cieling painting of a master artisan, or a royal tent establishing a realm of order and protection.

## Root

ר-ק-ע (r-q-') To hammer/spread out/stamp/stretch

Verb form: רָקַע (raqa) - to hammer/spread out, stamp, stretch, beat out

Noun form: רָקִיעַ (raqia) - that which is hammered/spread out

Closest English mapping: "a hammering-out", indicating something stretched out overhead to create a protected space beneath.

## In-Context

Genesis 1:6-8 "And God said, 'Let there be a **hammering-out** in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.' And God made the **hammering-out** and separated the waters that were under the **hammering-out** from the waters that were above the **hammering-out**. And it was so. And God called the **hammering-out** Heaven."

Genesis 1:14-15 "And God said, 'Let there be lights in the **hammering-out** of the heavens to separate the day from the night... and let them be lights in the **hammering-out** of the heavens to give light upon the earth.'"

Genesis 1:17 "And God set them in the **hammering-out** of the heavens to give light on the earth..."

Genesis 1:20 "And God said, 'Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the **hammering-out** of the heavens.'"

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), רָקִיעַ is translated as:

στερέωμα (stereōma) - firmament/solid structure

- From the verb στερεόω (stereoō) - to make firm or solid
- Emphasizes stability and solidity
- "God made the **firmament** (στερέωμα)" (Genesis 1:7 LXX)

This Greek term appears in the New Testament only once:

Colossians 2:5 "For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the **firmness** (στερέωμα) of your faith in Christ."

- Here Paul uses the term metaphorically for the solid foundation of faith
- Creates an implicit connection between the ordered cosmos and ordered faith

While the NT doesn't directly quote OT passages using רָקִיעַ, the conceptual framework of heaven as God's throne room builds on this imagery:

Matthew 5:34 "But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is God's throne"

Acts 7:49 "'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool'" (quoting Isaiah 66:1)

## Patterns

### Creation Structure Pattern

The רָקִיעַ plays a crucial role in the structured pattern of creation in Genesis 1, establishing a framework of separation and order:

**Day 1: Light separated from darkness**

- Creates temporal division (day/night)

**Day 2: Waters separated by the רָקִיעַ (hammering-out)**

- Creates spatial division (above/below)
- "Let there be a **hammering-out** in the midst of the waters" (Genesis 1:6)

**Day 3: Land separated from seas**

- Creates habitat division (dry/wet)

This pattern reveals how the רָקִיעַ functions as a critical boundary in creation, establishing the middle realm where life will flourish. The hammering-out creates the space where birds will fly (Day 5) and where celestial lights will be placed (Day 4).

### Divine Throne Pattern

The רָקִיעַ appears in key passages describing God's heavenly throne room:

**Ezekiel's Vision**

- "Over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of a **hammering-out**, shining like crystal... And above the **hammering-out** over their heads there was the likeness of a throne" (Ezekiel 1:22-26)
- The hammering-out forms the platform for God's throne
- Separates divine realm from created order below

**Psalm 150**

- "Praise him in his mighty **hammering-out**!" (Psalm 150:1)
- Associates the hammering-out with divine presence and power
- Place of praise and worship

**Exodus 24:10**

- "They saw the God of Israel. There was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness."
- While not using רָקִיעַ directly, describes the same concept
- Clear, crystal-like pavement under God's throne

This pattern shows how the רָקִיעַ serves not just as physical structure but as the boundary between divine and created realms, the platform upon which God's throne rests.

### Metalworking Imagery

The verbal root רָקַע (raqa) is used in contexts of metalworking, creating a pattern that illuminates the nature of the רָקִיעַ:

**Exodus 39:3**

- "And they hammered out (וַיְרַקְּעוּ, vayeraq'u) gold leaf, and cut it into threads"
- Shows the root meaning of hammering/spreading out

**Numbers 16:38-39**

- "Let them be made into hammered plates (רִקֻּעֵי, riqu'ei) as a covering for the altar"
- Demonstrates how the root connects to creating a covering

**Isaiah 40:19**

- "The craftsman casts an idol, and a goldsmith overlays (יְרַקְּעֶנּוּ, yeraq'enu) it with gold"
- Shows the spreading/overlaying aspect

**Jeremiah 10:9**

- "Beaten silver (מְרֻקָּע, meruqqa) is brought from Tarshish"
- Emphasizes the hammered, spread-out quality

This pattern reveals that the רָקִיעַ is not merely a space but a deliberately crafted structure, skillfully formed like a metalworker hammers out a thin sheet of precious metal, creating both beauty and function.

## Cultural Context

### Ancient Near Eastern Cosmology

For ancient Israelites, the רָקִיעַ would have evoked specific cosmological understandings:

**Egyptian Concepts**

- The sky goddess Nut formed an arched hammering-out over the earth
- Often depicted as a woman whose body forms the sky
- Unlike the biblical רָקִיעַ, this was personified and deified

**Mesopotamian Views**

- The epic Enuma Elish describes Marduk splitting Tiamat's body to form heaven and earth
- The upper half of her body becomes the sky, holding back celestial waters
- Unlike Genesis, this involves divine conflict and a slain deity

**Biblical Distinctive**

- The רָקִיעַ is neither personified nor divine
- Created by God's command rather than from divine substance
- Functions as ordered boundary rather than mythological being

### Tent-Making and Metalworking

Two common ancient crafts would have shaped how Israelites understood the רָקִיעַ:

**Tent-Making**

- Nomadic heritage of stretching tent coverings
- Isaiah 40:22: "who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to dwell in"
- The רָקִיעַ would evoke the protective covering of a well-made tent

**Metalworking**

- Skilled artisans hammering metal into thin sheets
- Exodus 39:3: Beating gold into thin sheets for tabernacle
- The רָקִיעַ suggests divine craftsmanship and intentional design

### Temple Symbolism

For Israelites familiar with the tabernacle and temple, the רָקִיעַ carried additional significance:

**Tabernacle Coverings**

- Multiple layers of stretched material formed the tabernacle roof
- Created sacred space below, mirroring cosmic structure
- Exodus 26 describes these coverings in detail

**Temple Ceiling**

- Solomon's temple featured blue-dyed ceiling decorations
- 1 Kings 6:15 mentions ceiling coverings
- Visually represented the רָקִיעַ above worshippers

**Holy of Holies**

- The innermost sanctuary represented God's throne room
- Cherubim figures echoed Ezekiel's vision of creatures beneath the רָקִיעַ
- Connected earthly worship with cosmic reality

### Agricultural Significance

For an agricultural society, the רָקִיעַ had practical significance:

**Weather Patterns**

- The רָקִיעַ controlled rain (waters above)
- Genesis 7:11: "the windows of the heavens were opened"
- Deuteronomy 28:12: "the LORD will open to you his good treasury, the heavens"

**Seasonal Markers**

- The lights in the רָקִיעַ marked seasons for planting and harvest
- Genesis 1:14: "let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years"
- Regulated agricultural calendar

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:

- A solid dome (based on older translations as "firmament")
- Empty space or atmosphere
- Outer space or the universe
- An obsolete scientific concept

Instead, picture:

- A royal tent hammering-out establishing protected space
- A masterfully crafted boundary maintaining cosmic order
- The floor of God's throne room
- A structure that both separates and connects divine and earthly realms

The רָקִיעַ is not primarily about material composition but about function—creating and maintaining the ordered space where life flourishes under divine protection and provision.
