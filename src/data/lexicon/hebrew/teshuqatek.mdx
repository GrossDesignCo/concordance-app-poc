# תְּשׁוּקָתֵךְ (Teshuqatek, attraction-your)

Picture a powerful magnetic force, drawing one object irresistibly toward another—not merely desire or longing, but an overwhelming orientation of one's whole being toward something or someone else.

## Root

#### Main Word: תְּשׁוּקָה (teshuqah) (attraction)

From root שׁ-ו-ק (sh-w-q)

- Primary meaning: strong drawing or pulling toward something

## In-Context

The word תְּשׁוּקָה (teshuqah) appears only 3 times in the Hebrew Bible:

Genesis 3:16 "To the woman He said, 'I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth, in pain you will bring forth children; yet toward your husband will be your **attraction**, and he will rule over you.'"

Genesis 4:7 "If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its **attraction** is toward you, but you must master it."

Song of Solomon 7:10 "I am my beloved's, and his **attraction** is toward me."

אַהֲבָה (ahavah) - love

- More comprehensive emotional attachment
- Can be commanded and chosen
- "For God so **loved** the world..." (John 3:16)

חָפֵץ (chafetz) - desire/delight

- Focuses on pleasure or satisfaction
- Often used for God's will or purpose
- "The LORD **delights** in those who fear him" (Psalm 147:11)

תַּאֲוָה (ta'avah) - craving/lust

חָשַׁק (chashaq) - attachment/longing

Unlike these words, תְּשׁוּקָה (teshuqah) emphasizes the gravitational, almost inevitable pull toward something or someone, rather than emotional content or moral quality.

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), תְּשׁוּקָה is translated as:

Genesis 3:16: ἀποστροφή (apostrophē) - turning/returning

- From ἀποστρέφω (apostrephō)
- Suggests orientation or direction rather than just desire
- This specific form doesn't appear in the NT

Genesis 4:7: ἀποστροφή (apostrophē) - turning/returning

- Same word as in Genesis 3:16
- Maintains the sense of orientation or direction

Song of Solomon 7:10: ἐπιστροφή (epistrophē) - turning/conversion

- From ἐπιστρέφω (epistrephō)
- Related to but distinct from ἀποστροφή
- Appears in Acts 15:3 regarding "the conversion of the Gentiles"

The Greek translations emphasize the directional aspect of תְּשׁוּקָה more than desire or longing, suggesting a turning or orientation toward something.

## Patterns

### The Relational Triangle

The three occurrences of תְּשׁוּקָה in Scripture form a significant theological pattern that spans from creation to fall to redemption:

1. **Woman to Man** (Genesis 3:16)

   - Context: Divine judgment after the Fall
   - "Your **attraction** will be toward your husband, and he will rule over you"
   - Represents distortion of the original creation order
   - Shows how sin affected human relationships

2. **Sin to Man** (Genesis 4:7)

   - Context: God's warning to Cain before his murder of Abel
   - "Sin is crouching at the door; and its **attraction** is toward you"
   - Personifies sin as having a gravitational pull on humanity
   - Shows how temptation works through attraction

3. **Man to Woman** (Song of Solomon 7:10)
   - Context: Mutual love celebration in covenant relationship
   - "I am my beloved's, and his **attraction** is toward me"
   - Represents restoration of proper relational order
   - Shows redeemed attraction in the context of committed love

This pattern reveals a theological progression:

- Creation's distortion (Genesis 3)
- Sin's power (Genesis 4)
- Love's redemption (Song of Solomon)

The pattern suggests that proper, redeemed human attraction mirrors divine love—directed toward the other rather than demanding from the other.

### Attraction and Authority

A secondary pattern emerges when examining the power dynamics associated with תְּשׁוּקָה:

1. **Subjection** (Genesis 3:16)

   - "Your **attraction** will be toward your husband, and he will rule over you"
   - Attraction paired with rule/dominion
   - Represents imbalanced relationship

2. **Mastery** (Genesis 4:7)

   - "Its **attraction** is toward you, but you must master it"
   - Attraction paired with command to rule over it
   - Represents spiritual warfare

3. **Mutuality** (Song of Solomon 7:10)
   - "I am my beloved's, and his **attraction** is toward me"
   - Attraction paired with belonging
   - Represents balanced, covenant relationship

This pattern shows a progression from:

- Distorted hierarchy (Genesis 3)
- Spiritual struggle (Genesis 4)
- Redeemed mutuality (Song of Solomon)

The progression suggests that while תְּשׁוּקָה itself is neutral, its proper expression exists within covenant relationships characterized by mutual submission rather than domination.

## Cultural Context

### Ancient Near Eastern Understanding

In the ancient Near East, the concept of attraction carried significant social and theological implications:

#### Agricultural Imagery

For ancient agrarian societies, powerful forces of nature provided ready metaphors for human experience:

- Gravitational pull of water seeking its level
- Magnetic properties of certain stones
- Plant growth toward sunlight
- Animal mating instincts

These natural phenomena would have informed how ancient readers understood תְּשׁוּקָה—not as mere emotion but as a fundamental orienting force.

#### Covenant Relationships

Ancient Near Eastern covenant relationships were characterized by:

- Mutual obligations
- Hierarchical structures
- Binding commitments
- Protective boundaries

Within this framework, תְּשׁוּקָה would have been understood not just as romantic attraction but as a covenantal orientation—the fundamental direction of one's loyalty and commitment.

#### Gender Dynamics

The ancient world's understanding of gender relations provides important context:

- Patriarchal social structures
- Distinct gender roles
- Economic dependencies
- Family-centered society

The use of תְּשׁוּקָה in Genesis 3:16 would have been understood within these social realities, describing not just emotional desire but social and economic dependency resulting from the Fall.

### Theological Significance

The limited but strategic placement of תְּשׁוּקָה in Scripture creates a theological trajectory:

1. **Creation Design**

   - Implied but not stated in Genesis 1-2
   - Mutual attraction without domination
   - Balanced relationship before the Fall

2. **Fallen Distortion**

   - Genesis 3:16 - Woman's attraction to man paired with his rule
   - Genesis 4:7 - Sin's attraction to humanity
   - Represents how sin distorts proper orientation

3. **Redemptive Restoration**
   - Song of Solomon 7:10 - Mutual attraction in covenant love
   - Man's attraction toward woman (reversing Genesis 3:16)
   - Represents how grace restores proper orientation

This trajectory suggests that while תְּשׁוּקָה itself is not inherently negative, its proper expression is found in covenant relationships characterized by mutual submission and love.

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:

- Romantic desire or sexual attraction
- Personal preference or taste
- Emotional longing or yearning
- Individual choice or decision

Instead, picture:

- Gravitational pull between celestial bodies
- Magnetic force drawing objects together
- Plant growing toward sunlight
- River inevitably flowing toward the sea

The power of תְּשׁוּקָה is not primarily emotional but orientational—determining the fundamental direction of one's being. It describes not just what we want but what claims us, not just what we desire but what defines us.
