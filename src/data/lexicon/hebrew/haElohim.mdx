# הָאֱלֹהִים (haElohim, the-Gods)

Picture a singular supreme authority who nonetheless contains plurality within himself—like a council with one voice or a symphony conducted by its composer. This word uniquely combines grammatical plurality with conceptual unity to express the fullness of divine being.

## Root

### Compound Structure

הָ (ha-) + אֱלֹהִים (Elohim)

#### Prefix: הָ (ha-) (the-)

- Basic meaning: "the"
- Definite article in Hebrew
- When attached to a word, it specifies a particular entity rather than a general class
- Indicates something known, established, or uniquely identifiable

#### Main Word: אֱלֹהִים (Elohim) (Gods)

From root א-ל-ה (ʾ-l-h)

- Primary meaning: divine being(s), deity
- Plural form of אֱלוֹהַּ (Eloah, God)
- Despite plural form, typically takes singular verbs when referring to the God of Israel
- Maintains grammatical plurality while functioning conceptually as a unity

Closest English mapping: "the-Gods"

This translation:
- Preserves the grammatical plurality of the Hebrew
- Maintains the definite article
- Allows the reader to encounter the same tension present in the original text
- Distinguishes from the singular forms אֵל (El) and אֱלוֹהַּ (Eloah)

## In-Context

Genesis 1:1 "In the beginning **the-Gods** created the heavens and the earth." Note: Plural noun with singular verb (בָּרָא, bara, "he created"), establishing the pattern of unity-in-plurality.

Exodus 3:6 "Moreover He said, 'I am **the-Gods** of your father—**the-Gods** of Abraham, **the-Gods** of Isaac, and **the-Gods** of Jacob.'" Note: Identifies the covenant relationship with Israel's patriarchs.

Exodus 20:2 "I am Iam your **the-Gods** who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." Note: Self-identification at the beginning of the Ten Commandments.

Deuteronomy 6:4 "Hear, O Israel: Iam our **the-Gods**, Iam is one!" Note: Classic statement of monotheism despite the plural form.

Psalm 82:1 "**The-Gods** stands in the congregation of the mighty; He judges among **the-gods**." Note: Distinguishes between הָאֱלֹהִים (with article) and אֱלֹהִים (without article).

1 Kings 18:39 "Iam, He is **the-Gods**! Iam, He is **the-Gods**!" Note: Climactic declaration after Elijah's contest with the prophets of Baal.

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), הָאֱלֹהִים is typically translated as:

ὁ θεός (ho theos) - "the God"

- Singular form with definite article
- Resolves the Hebrew plurality into Greek singularity
- Genesis 1:1: "In the beginning **the God** (ὁ θεός) created the heaven and the earth."

This Greek rendering influenced New Testament usage, where θεός (theos) becomes the standard term for God:

John 1:1-2: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with **God** (τὸν θεόν), and the Word was **God** (θεός). He was in the beginning with **God** (τὸν θεόν)."

Matthew 22:32: "I am **the God** (ὁ θεός) of Abraham, and **the God** (ὁ θεός) of Isaac, and **the God** (ὁ θεός) of Jacob." (Jesus quoting Exodus 3:6)

Acts 7:32: "I am **the God** (ὁ θεός) of your fathers, **the God** (ὁ θεός) of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob." (Stephen quoting Exodus 3:6)

The shift from Hebrew plural (Elohim) to Greek singular (ho theos) represents an important theological translation decision that shaped how early Christians conceptualized God while maintaining monotheistic commitment.

## Patterns

### Creation Pattern

הָאֱלֹהִים appears prominently in creation contexts, establishing divine authority over all existence:

Genesis 1:1-2:3 - The creation narrative uses הָאֱלֹהִים exclusively (not YHWH):
- "**The-Gods** created the heavens and the earth." (Genesis 1:1)
- "**The-Gods** said, 'Let there be light.'" (Genesis 1:3)
- "**The-Gods** saw that it was good." (recurring phrase)
- "**The-Gods** blessed them." (Genesis 1:22, 28)
- "**The-Gods** finished his work." (Genesis 2:2)

This pattern establishes several key theological points:
1. Creation is an act of divine authority
2. The plural form suggests fullness of divine power
3. The singular verbs maintain monotheistic understanding
4. Creation proceeds through verbal declaration ("**The-Gods** said...")

### Covenant Identity Pattern

הָאֱלֹהִים frequently appears in self-identification formulas establishing covenant relationship:

Exodus 20:2: "I am Iam your **the-Gods** who brought you out of the land of Egypt."

Leviticus 11:44: "For I am Iam your **the-Gods**. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy."

Exodus 6:7: "I will take you as my people, and I will be your **the-Gods**."

This pattern establishes:
1. The personal nature of Israel's God despite the abstract plural form
2. The exclusive covenant relationship
3. The ethical demands flowing from this relationship
4. The historical basis of God's authority (exodus from Egypt)

### Judgment Pattern

הָאֱלֹהִים appears in contexts of divine judgment, emphasizing divine authority:

Genesis 6:12: "**The-Gods** looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt."

Exodus 22:8-9: "Both parties shall come before **the-Gods**; he whom **the-Gods** condemn shall pay double to his neighbor."

Psalm 50:6: "**The-Gods**, **the-Gods** Iam, has spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting."

This pattern reveals:
1. Divine authority as the basis for judgment
2. The comprehensive scope of divine judgment
3. The ethical standards derived from God's character
4. The legal function of divine authority in Israelite society

### Wisdom Pattern

הָאֱלֹהִים appears in wisdom contexts, connecting divine wisdom with creation and moral order:

Proverbs 2:5: "Then you will understand the fear of Iam and find the knowledge of **the-Gods**."

Ecclesiastes 2:26: "For to the one who pleases him **the-Gods** has given wisdom and knowledge and joy."

Job 28:23: "**The-Gods** understands the way to it, and he knows its place."

This pattern establishes:
1. Divine wisdom as the foundation of human wisdom
2. The connection between creation order and moral order
3. The limits of human wisdom compared to divine wisdom
4. The fear of God as the beginning of wisdom

### The Grammatical Plurality Pattern

The most distinctive pattern of הָאֱלֹהִים is its grammatical plurality combined with conceptual unity:

Genesis 1:26: "Then **the-Gods** said, 'Let **us** make man in **our** image, after **our** likeness.'" Note: Plural noun with plural pronouns.

Genesis 1:27: "So **the-Gods** created man in **his** own image." Note: Plural noun with singular possessive.

Genesis 11:7-8: "Come, let **us** go down and there confuse their language... So Iam dispersed them." Note: Plural pronouns with singular divine name.

This pattern creates a theological tension that becomes significant for later trinitarian theology:
1. Maintains strict monotheism while suggesting divine plurality
2. Uses plural form with singular verbs to express complex unity
3. Occasionally employs plural pronouns with הָאֱלֹהִים
4. Creates space for later trinitarian understanding while preserving monotheistic commitment

## Cultural Context

### Ancient Near Eastern Background

The plural form Elohim stands in stark contrast to how Israel's neighbors named their deities. While Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and Canaanite religions had pantheons with many named gods, Israel used a grammatically plural term with singular verbs to describe their one God.

Neighboring cultures used specific names for deities that reflected their domains:
- Baal (storm/fertility)
- Asherah (fertility/motherhood)
- Marduk (chief Babylonian deity)
- Chemosh (Moabite national deity)
- Re/Ra (Egyptian sun god)

Against this background, Israel's use of הָאֱלֹהִים communicated:
1. Their God encompassed all divine domains
2. Their God was not limited to natural phenomena
3. Their God possessed the fullness of divine attributes
4. Their monotheism was qualitatively different from polytheism

### Divine Council Imagery

The plural form may reflect the ancient "divine council" concept found throughout the Ancient Near East, where a high god presided over lesser divine beings. Biblical texts adapt this imagery while transforming its meaning:

Psalm 82:1: "**The-Gods** stands in the divine assembly; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment."

1 Kings 22:19: "I saw Iam sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside him."

Job 1:6: "Now there was a day when the sons of **the-Gods** came to present themselves before Iam."

This imagery suggests:
1. Iam/הָאֱלֹהִים presides over all spiritual beings
2. Other spiritual beings are subordinate, not peers
3. Divine authority remains singular despite heavenly plurality
4. The plural form may acknowledge this heavenly court while maintaining God's uniqueness

### Royal Plurality

The plural form may also reflect royal language, where ancient monarchs used plural self-reference to express their comprehensive authority:

Genesis 1:26: "Let **us** make man in **our** image" parallels royal proclamations.

This "plural of majesty" suggests:
1. Divine sovereignty over all creation
2. Fullness of divine authority
3. Comprehensive nature of divine action
4. Connection between divine and human rulership

### Linguistic Development

The term הָאֱלֹהִים represents a significant development in religious language:

1. From concrete to abstract: Unlike deities named after natural phenomena, הָאֱלֹהִים represents a move toward abstract conceptualization of deity.

2. From local to universal: Unlike national deities limited to territories, הָאֱלֹהִים claims universal jurisdiction.

3. From plurality to complex unity: The grammatical tension creates a conceptual framework that can express complex divine unity.

4. From mythological to theological: The term shifts divine language from mythological storytelling to theological reflection.

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- Simple numerical plurality (multiple gods)
- A formal title like "the Almighty"
- An abstract concept of divinity
- A simple proper name

Instead, picture:
- A singular being containing fullness of divine attributes
- A unity that encompasses plurality without division
- A sovereign who speaks both as "I" and "we"
- The tension between one and many resolved in perfect unity

The term הָאֱלֹהִים creates a linguistic space where later trinitarian theology could develop while maintaining strict monotheism. The grammatical plurality combined with conceptual unity provides a framework for understanding complex divine oneness that transcends simple numerical categories.
