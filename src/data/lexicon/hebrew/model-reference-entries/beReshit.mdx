# בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית (beReshit, in-heading)

Picture the head of a river where waters first spring forth, or the head of a body directing all its movements \- this word captures not just the start, but the source and direction. Just as a head both leads and guides a body, this word indicates both priority and ongoing governance.

## Root

### Compound Structure

בְּ (be-) \+ רֵאשִׁ֖ית (reshit)

#### Prefix: בְּ (be-) (in-)

- Basic meaning: "in/with/by"
- One of the inseparable prepositions in Hebrew
- When attached to a word, it often indicates location (physical or temporal)
- Can also indicate means or instrument ("by means of")

#### Main Word: רֵאשִׁ֖ית (reshit) (heading)

From root ר-א-שׁ (r-'-sh)

- Primary concrete meaning from רֹאשׁ (rosh) \= head
- Abstract noun formed with the ית- (-it) suffix, similar to how English "-ing" can form abstract nouns, just like head to heading
- Indicates both temporal and qualitative primacy
- Maintains connection to physical meaning of "head" while extending to abstract concepts

Closest English mapping: "in-heading"

This translation:

- Preserves connection to physical רֹאשׁ (head) while showing abstraction
- Uses \-ing to parallel Hebrew \-it suffix
- Creates a distinct term that can carry both temporal and governing aspects
- Functions in both absolute and construct forms

## In-Context

Genesis 1:1 "**In-heading** God created the heavens and the earth." Note: Here בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית appears in absolute form, establishing not just when but how creation proceeds \- from and under divine guidance.

Proverbs 8:22 "IAM possessed me as **heading-of** His way, before His works of old." Note: Here רֵאשִׁית appears in construct with "His way," showing wisdom's role as both temporal beginning and governing principle.

Jeremiah 26:1 "**In-heading-of** the reign of Jehoiakim..." Note: Shows temporal use while maintaining connection to authority/governance.

Genesis 49:3 "Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and **heading-of** my strength." Note: Links physical firstborn status with primacy of position, showing how רֵאשִׁית bridges concrete and abstract meanings.

## Biblical Patterns & Themes

### Creation

בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית establishes key creation themes that echo throughout Scripture:

Genesis 1:1 "**In-heading** God created the heavens and the earth." Note: Just as a head directs a body's growth, this opening shows divine authority directing creation's unfolding.

Proverbs 8:22-30 "Iam possessed me as **heading-of** his way, before his works of old... when he established the heavens, I was there..." Note: Wisdom present at creation's head, guiding its development like thoughts direct actions.

Isaiah 46:10 "Declaring heading from end, and from ancient times things not yet done." Note: Shows God's authority over time itself, heading both its direction and purpose.

### In Wisdom Literature

The word bridges creation and wisdom through key passages showing how each flows from divine headship:

Proverbs 1:7 "**Heading-of** knowledge is fear of Iam." Note: Fear of Iam heads/governs true knowledge.

Proverbs 4:7 "**Heading-of** wisdom: acquire wisdom, and in all your acquiring, acquire understanding." Note: Shows wisdom's headship over all other pursuits.

Psalm 111:10 "**Heading-of** wisdom is fear of Iam; good understanding have all who practice it." Note: Links divine authority (fear of Iam) with wisdom's proper ordering.

### Indicating Royal Authority

רֵאשִׁית connects to themes of authority and rulership:

Genesis 49:3 "Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and **heading-of** my strength." Note: Links physical firstborn status with authority and governing strength.

Deuteronomy 21:17 "For he is **heading-of** his strength; right of firstborn is his." Note: Shows how headship carries both authority and responsibility.

Numbers 24:20 "Amalek was **heading-of** nations, but his end will be destruction." Note: Contrasts position of headship with loss of authority through opposition to God.

### In the Sacrificial System

רֵאשִׁית shows how offerings represent divine headship over all provision:

Exodus 23:19 "**Heading-of** the land's fruit you shall bring to house of Iam your God." Note: Offering acknowledges God's headship over all produce.

Numbers 15:20-21 "**Heading-of** your dough you shall lift as an offering... from **heading-of** your dough you shall give to Iam an offering throughout your generations." Note: Regular offering shows continuous recognition of divine authority.

Ezekiel 44:30 "**Heading-of** all firstfruits of all kinds, and every offering of all kinds from all your offerings, shall belong to the priests." Note: Priestly portion represents divine headship over Israel's worship.

### As the Head of a Body

The רֵאשִׁית concept develops into a full theology of headship:

Deuteronomy 28:13 "Iam will make you the **head** and not the tail." - physical metaphor for Israel's position among the nations.

1 Samuel 15:17 Though you were small in your own eyes, were you not made **head** of the tribes of Israel?" - Samuel speaking to Saul about his position and responsibility.

Psalm 118:22 "The stone which the builders rejected has become the **head** of the corner." - Direct allusion to the coming Christ, which is reflected in the later Greek translation.

This pattern shows how רֵאשִׁית consistently carries both authority and responsibility, governing while providing for what it heads.

## Translation Notes

Standard English translations vary:

- "In the beginning" (most common in Genesis 1:1)
- "When God began" (NJPS and some modern translations)
- "First" or "best" (in construct chains)
- "Chief" (in leadership contexts)

We render בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית as "in-heading" to preserve several key features of the Hebrew:

### Root Connection

- רֵאשִׁ֖ית (reshit) derives from רֹאשׁ (rosh) meaning "head"
- English "heading" maintains this connection to "head"
- Preserves concrete-to-abstract development in Hebrew thought

### Usage Range

- "In-heading" works for creation (Genesis 1:1)
- "Heading-of" works in construct chains
- Preserves connection between temporal and authority meanings

While this translation may initially sound unusual to English readers, it helps recover the Hebrew connection between physical headship and abstract primacy that is often lost in traditional translations.

## Common Misunderstandings

- Often misunderstood as only temporal
- Not just "once upon a time"
- Not necessarily absolute beginning
- Wisdom connection often missed

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית is translated as:

Genesis 1:1: Ἐν ἀρχῇ (En archē)

- "In beginning"
- Lacks article in Greek
- John 1:1 echoes this phrase

Proverbs 8:22: ἀρχὴν (archēn)

- Accusative form
- Focus on temporal aspect
- Less emphasis on quality

## Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:

- Simple chronological start
- Once upon a time
- Mathematical beginning point
- Abstract concept

Instead, picture:

- Cornerstone determining all alignment
- Seed containing tree's pattern
- Foundation establishing structure
- First stroke of artist defining composition

The word carries both temporal and qualitative primacy, establishing not just when but how and why creation unfolds.
