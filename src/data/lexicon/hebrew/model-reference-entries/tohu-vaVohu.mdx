# תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ (Tohu vaVohu, waste and-void)

Picture a primordial wasteland: not just empty, but actively resisting order and habitation \- an anti-creation state that existed before God's creation work. Like a desert that not only lacks life but seems to defy it, or ruins so complete they negate the very memory of what stood before.

## Roots

### תֹ֙הוּ֙ (tohu)

ת-ה-ו (t-h-w) \- Formlessness, confusion, un-reality

### וָבֹ֔הוּ (vohu)

ב-ה-ו (b-h-w) \- Emptiness, void

The pair creates an amplified compound concept, similar to the doubling of "holy-holy". The \-hu ending on both words creates a rhyming reinforcement suggesting completeness.

Closest English mapping: "waste and-void" \- preserving both the conjunction and the dual aspects of formlessness and emptiness while maintaining some of the phonetic impact of the original.

## In-Context

The phrase appears in three key passages, each describing either an initial state before God's creative work or the result of His un-creating judgment:

Genesis 1:2 "And the earth was **waste and-void**, and darkness was over the face of the deep..."

- Presents an initial state before God's action
- Paired with darkness and deep waters to amplify the imagery

Jeremiah 4:23 "I looked at the earth, and behold, it was **waste and-void**; and to the heavens, and they had no light."

- Vision of judgment undoing creation
- Deliberate echo of Genesis 1:2
- Represents complete and utter devastation, un-creation

Isaiah 34:11 "...He shall stretch over it the line of **waste** and the stones of **void**."

- Prophecy of judgment against Edom
- Measuring tools normally used for building are used for un-building
- Words separated but clearly echo the Genesis language

## Related Concepts

שָׁמֵם (shamem) \- Desolation

- Used for inhabited places made uninhabitable
- Implies devastation of what once was
- "The land is made **desolate**" (Jeremiah 4:27)

חָרֵב (charev) \- Ruin/Waste

- Focuses on physical destruction
- Often used for cities and buildings
- "The cities will be **ruined**" (Ezekiel 6:6)

רִיק (riq) \- Emptiness

- More neutral emptiness
- Can be filled or useful
- "**Empty** vessels" (2 Kings 4:3)

Unlike these words, Tohu vaVohu describes a more fundamental disorder \- not just the absence of order/creation but its opposite.

## Patterns & Themes

### Anti-Creation

This pattern appears in both creative and un-creative contexts:

1. Before creation (Genesis 1:2)
2. In judgment undoing creation (Jeremiah 4:23)
3. In prophecies of devastating judgment (Isaiah 34:11)

### Measuring Line

Isaiah's usage connects to a broader pattern of measuring lines in Scripture:

- Usually for building (Zechariah 1:16)
- Sometimes for judgment (2 Kings 21:13)
- In Isaiah 34:11, measuring for tohu shows complete reversal of purpose

### Genesis 1 Echos

Later uses deliberately echo Genesis 1:2:

- Same vocabulary
- Similar word order
- Associated with darkness
- Connected to waters

These parallels create a theological link between pre-creation and judgment.

## Translation Notes

Standard English translations vary:

- "without form and void" (KJV, ESV)
- "formless and empty" (NIV)
- "waste and void" (ASV)
- "chaos" (NETS \- Septuagint)
- "welter and waste" (Alter)

## Common Misunderstandings

- Often misunderstood as simple emptiness or chaotic primordial material
- Not merely absence of form but resistance to it
- Not just empty space but active negation
- The repetition is more than phonetic but emphasizes totality

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ is translated as:

- Genesis 1:2: ἀόρατος καὶ ἀκατασκεύαστος \- "Invisible and unformed/unprepared"
- Isaiah 34:11: εἰς τὸ κενὸν \- "Into the void"
- Jeremiah 4:23: οὐθέν \- "Nothing"

## Ancient Context

The radical nature of Genesis' Tohu vaVohu becomes clear when compared with neighboring creation myths. These contrasts highlight the biblical account's distinctive theological vision.

### Ancient Near Eastern Creation Myths

In ancient cosmologies, creation began with chaos that required divine combat to overcome. These weren't passive states awaiting order, but personified deities actively opposing creation.

Egyptian mythology featured Nun, the primordial waters personified as a deity containing both destructive and creative potential. Unlike biblical chaos, Nun persisted at the world's edges as a constant threat. Similarly, Isfet (chaos) stood in perpetual opposition to Ma'at (order), requiring endless ritualistic maintenance.

Mesopotamian creation centered on divine conflict. In the Enuma Elish, Marduk battled Tiamat (saltwater ocean) and created the world from her corpse. Creation emerged not from sovereign speech but from violence against a divine antagonist.

Canaanite myths portrayed Yamm (Sea) as Baal's divine rival in a cyclical cosmic struggle between order and chaos. This seasonal conflict was mirrored in Baal's battles with Mot (Death), directly connecting chaos with agricultural fertility cycles.

### Biblical Distinctives

Genesis presents chaos fundamentally differently. Four key contrasts emerge:

1. Genesis demythologizes chaos. Tohu vaVohu possesses no will, power, or divine status—it's simply an initial condition awaiting divine ordering.
2. creation requires no battle. God transforms disorder through sovereign speech alone. "And God said..." replaces the violent combat narratives dominating ancient cosmologies.
3. this approach suggests creation ex nihilo (from nothing). Without competing primordial powers, God's creative authority becomes absolute and unconstrained.
4. Tohu vaVohu connects creation and judgment. The same terms describing pre-creation reappear in prophetic visions, suggesting judgment involves not cosmic conflict but the withdrawal of God's ordering presence.

While surrounding cultures depicted creation as warfare against personified chaos, Genesis presents Tohu vaVohu as merely the "before" picture—a state with no power or personality awaiting the Creator's word.

## Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:

- Empty space
- Random chaos
- Primitive disorder
- Raw materials

Instead, picture:

- A building's blueprint with anti-instructions
- A photograph's negative
- A place actively resisting order
- The opposite of creation itself

The phrase doesn't just describe absence but the very antithesis of created order.
