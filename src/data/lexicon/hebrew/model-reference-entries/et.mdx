# אֵ֥ת (et, ↳)

Picture a man speaking, and as he speaks, he points at the objects he's talking about. et, "↳" serves as a written equivalent, pointing explicitly to the object being referenced.

## Root

אֵ֥ת (et) - Direct Object Marker

Closest English mapping: "↳" (a directional arrow), indicating the recipient of an action. Since English has no exact equivalent, we use this symbol to show where the Hebrew marks the direct object.

## In-Context

Genesis 1:1 "In the beginning God created **↳** the heavens and **↳** the earth."

Exodus 20:12 "Honor **↳** your father and **↳** your mother..."

Deuteronomy 6:5 "You shall love **↳** the LORD your God with all your heart..."

1 Samuel 3:10 "Speak, for your servant is listening." (Here Samuel speaks to God without using the marker, showing informal speech)

Isaiah 6:1 "I saw **↳** the Lord sitting upon a throne..."

## Related Concepts

עִם ('im) - with

- Indicates accompaniment or proximity
- Relational rather than directional
- "Abraham walked **with** God"

אֶל (el) - to/toward

- Indicates direction or movement
- Shows intent rather than direct action
- "Moses spoke **to** the people"

לְ (le) - for/to

- Indicates purpose or indirect object
- Shows beneficiary rather than direct recipient
- "David built an altar **for** the LORD"

Unlike these words, אֵ֥ת does not add meaning but only marks direct objects.

## Compound Forms

### אֵת + Pronominal Suffixes

The direct object marker can combine with pronoun suffixes to create forms like:

אֹתִי (oti) - "↳ me"

- "The LORD called **↳ me** from the womb" (Isaiah 49:1)

אֹתְךָ (otkha) - "↳ you" (masculine singular)

- "I will bless **↳ you**" (Genesis 12:2)

אֹתָהּ (otah) - "↳ her"

- "When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw **↳ her**" (Genesis 12:14)

אֹתָם (otam) - "↳ them" (masculine plural)

- "God blessed **↳ them**" (Genesis 1:22)

### אֵת כָּל (et kol) - "↳ all/every"

This extremely common construction marks totality:

- "Noah took **↳ all** clean animals" (Genesis 7:2)
- "You shall teach **↳ all** these words to your children" (Deuteronomy 6:7)

### אֵת אֲשֶׁר (et asher) - "↳ that which"

Marks relative clauses as direct objects:

- "I have given you **↳ that which** grows" (Genesis 1:29)
- "Remember **↳ that which** the LORD did" (Deuteronomy 7:18)

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

The Septuagint (LXX) typically does not translate אֵ֥ת with a specific Greek word, as Greek, like English, marks direct objects through case endings (accusative case) rather than a separate particle.

In Greek:

- Direct objects appear in the accusative case
- No separate marker is needed
- Word order often signals the object's role

For example, Genesis 1:1 in Greek:
"Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν."
(The accusative articles τὸν and τὴν mark the direct objects)

This grammatical difference between Hebrew and Greek occasionally creates translation challenges, especially in ambiguous constructions where the direct object marker clarifies relationships that must be inferred in Greek.

## Patterns

### Creation

In Genesis 1, the direct object marker appears in a distinct pattern that emphasizes God's intentional, direct creation:

- "God created **↳** the heavens and **↳** the earth" (Genesis 1:1)
- "God made **↳** the expanse" (Genesis 1:7)
- "God made **↳** the two great lights" (Genesis 1:16)
- "God created **↳** the great sea creatures" (Genesis 1:21)
- "God made **↳** the beasts of the earth" (Genesis 1:25)
- "God created **↳** man in his own image" (Genesis 1:27)

This pattern emphasizes that creation wasn't accidental or indirect—each element was deliberately formed as the direct object of God's creative action.

### Covenant Formula

In covenant contexts, the direct object marker often appears in a specific formula that emphasizes the comprehensive nature of God's commitment:

- "I will establish **↳** my covenant" (Genesis 6:18, 9:11, 17:7)
- "Remember **↳** your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" (Exodus 32:13)
- "The LORD your God is keeping with you **↳** the covenant" (Deuteronomy 7:12)

This pattern highlights the covenant itself as the direct object of God's action, emphasizing the deliberate, formal nature of these agreements.

### Law-Giving

When communicating divine commands, the marker creates a pattern emphasizing the specific, concrete nature of each instruction:

- "You shall not make for yourself **↳** a carved image" (Exodus 20:4)
- "Honor **↳** your father and **↳** your mother" (Exodus 20:12)
- "You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal." (Exodus 20:13-15, where the marker is absent in these short prohibitions)

The pattern of presence or absence of the marker in commandments creates a rhythm that helps distinguish between different types of legal formulations.

### Prophetic Vision

In prophetic literature, the marker often appears in vision reports, emphasizing the concrete nature of what the prophet perceives:

- "I saw **↳** the Lord sitting upon a throne" (Isaiah 6:1)
- "The LORD showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple" (Jeremiah 24:1, where the marker is used with "showed")
- "He showed me **↳** Joshua the high priest" (Zechariah 3:1)

This pattern underscores that prophetic visions involve direct perception of specific objects or persons, not merely abstract ideas.

## Cultural Context

### Grammatical Consciousness

For ancient Hebrew readers and hearers, the direct object marker would have created a rhythm and structure to sentences that helped clarify meaning:

- In oral recitation, it would signal "attention: object coming"
- In legal contexts, it would precisely identify what was regulated
- In narrative, it would track what was happening to whom

Unlike English readers who rely primarily on word order (subject-verb-object), Hebrew audiences used these markers to follow the action regardless of word order variations.

### Theological Implications

While primarily grammatical, the marker carries subtle theological weight in certain contexts:

- Creation texts: Emphasizes God's direct, intentional action
- Covenant language: Highlights the specific, concrete promises
- Legal material: Precisely identifies what is permitted or forbidden
- Prophetic literature: Distinguishes between direct divine action and secondary causes

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern English readers miss the marker entirely since it has no direct equivalent.
