# מֹשֶׁה (Moshe, Draws_Out)

Picture a child being pulled from dangerous waters, rescued by gentle hands that lift him to safety and a new destiny – this image captures the essence of Moses' name, which became both his identity and a prophetic description of his life's mission.

## Root

מ-ש-ה (m-sh-h) - To draw out/pull out (from water)

Closest English mapping: "Draws_Out", indicating the action of pulling or extracting something (particularly from water).

### Etymology

- From Egyptian root "mose/mses" (meaning "born/child") combined with Hebrew verbal root משה (mashah)

- Exodus 2:10 provides the biblical etymology: "She named him Moses (מֹשֶׁה), saying, 'Because I **drew_him_out** (מְשִׁיתִהוּ, meshitihu) of the water.'"

This Greek form appears approximately 80 times in the New Testament:

## Patterns

### The Drawing Out Pattern

Moses' name establishes a recurring pattern of "drawing out" that appears throughout his life and ministry:

**Physical Drawing Out**

- Drawn from water as infant (Exodus 2:10)
- Drew water for Jethro's daughters (Exodus 2:19)
- Drew water from rock at Horeb (Exodus 17:6)
- Drew water from rock at Meribah (Numbers 20:11)

**People Drawing Out**

- Drew Israel out of Egypt (Exodus 3:10)
- "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son" (Hosea 11:1)
- Drew the Levites out as dedicated servants (Numbers 8:6-14)
- Drew Joshua out as successor (Numbers 27:18-23)

**Spiritual Drawing Out**

- Drew out God's law at Sinai (Exodus 20-23)
- Drew out God's presence in the Tabernacle (Exodus 40:34-38)
- Drew out God's mercy after Israel's sin (Exodus 32:11-14)
- Drew out deeper revelation of God's nature (Exodus 33:18-23)

This pattern culminates in the New Testament understanding of Moses as a type of Christ:

- As Moses drew Israel from Egypt, Christ draws believers from sin
- As Moses lifted the serpent, Christ was lifted up (John 3:14)
- As Moses mediated the old covenant, Christ mediates the new (Hebrews 8:6)
- As Moses drew water from rock, Christ gives living water (1 Corinthians 10:4)

### The Prophet Like Moses Pattern

Deuteronomy 18:15-18 establishes a prophetic pattern that shapes Israel's messianic expectations:

"IAM your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen... I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him."

This pattern includes:

**Mediatorial Role**

- Moses: "IAM used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend" (Exodus 33:11)
- Jesus: "No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known" (John 1:18)

**Miraculous Confirmation**

- Moses: Performed signs to validate his mission (Exodus 4:1-9)
- Jesus: "The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me" (John 10:25)

**Covenant Establishment**

- Moses: Mediated covenant at Sinai (Exodus 24:8)
- Jesus: "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20)

**Intercessory Ministry**

- Moses: "But Moses implored IAM his God" (Exodus 32:11)
- Jesus: "He always lives to make intercession for them" (Hebrews 7:25)

**Liberation Mission**

- Moses: Led Israel from physical bondage
- Jesus: "So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed" (John 8:36)

The New Testament explicitly identifies Jesus as this prophet:

Acts 3:22-23 "Moses said, 'The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you. And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.'"

Acts 7:37 "This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, 'God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.'"

### The Veiled Face Pattern

Moses' veiled face (Exodus 34:29-35) establishes a pattern that Paul interprets in 2 Corinthians 3:7-18:

**The Original Pattern**

- Moses' face shone after speaking with God
- Israelites were afraid to approach him
- Moses veiled his face when speaking to the people
- Removed the veil when speaking with God

**Paul's Interpretation**

- The glory of the old covenant was temporary
- The veil represents spiritual blindness
- "When one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed"
- Believers behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled faces

This pattern contrasts the old and new covenants:

- Moses: temporary glory, veiled revelation
- Christ: permanent glory, unveiled revelation

## Cultural Context

### Egyptian and Hebrew Identities

Moses' name reflects his dual identity, bridging Egyptian and Hebrew worlds:

**Egyptian Elements**

- Name contains Egyptian element "mose" (born/child)
- Similar to names like Thutmose ("born of Thoth") or Rameses ("born of Ra")
- Raised in Egyptian royal household
- "Learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians" (Acts 7:22)

**Hebrew Reinterpretation**

- Hebrew etymology connects to משה (mashah, "to draw out")
- Transforms Egyptian royal name into story of divine rescue
- Foreshadows his role in drawing Israel from Egypt
- Establishes his identity with enslaved Hebrews

This dual identity made Moses uniquely qualified for his mediatorial role:

- Egyptian education provided leadership training
- Hebrew identity connected him to God's covenant people
- Experience in both worlds prepared him to lead Israel from one to the other

### Moses in Ancient Near Eastern Context

Moses' role as lawgiver and prophet can be understood against the backdrop of ancient Near Eastern leadership patterns:

**Comparison with ANE Lawgivers**

- Hammurabi (Babylon): Claimed divine authority for laws
- Moses: Presented as mediator, not source of law
- ANE laws often glorified the king
- Mosaic law emphasized covenant relationship with God

**Prophetic Leadership**

- ANE prophets often served royal courts
- Moses established pattern of prophets who challenged rulers
- ANE prophets focused on immediate concerns
- Mosaic tradition emphasized long-term covenant faithfulness

**Literary Context**

- ANE treaties followed patterns similar to covenant structure in Exodus-Deuteronomy
- Moses' speeches in Deuteronomy resemble treaty documents
- Historical prologue, stipulations, blessings/curses parallel ANE treaty forms
- Moses' role as covenant mediator would be recognizable to ancient audiences

### Moses in Jewish Tradition

By the first century AD, Moses held a central place in Jewish thought:

**Rabbinic Veneration**

- Called "Moshe Rabbeinu" (Moses our Teacher)
- Considered greatest of all prophets
- Tradition claimed he received both written and oral Torah
- Some traditions suggested he pre-existed creation

**Messianic Expectations**

- Prophet like Moses expected (Deuteronomy 18:15-18)
- Some expected Moses-like deliverer from Roman rule
- Qumran community anticipated prophet and messiah(s)
- John 1:21 shows people asking John the Baptist if he was "the Prophet"

**Moses Imagery in Jesus' Ministry**

- Sermon on the Mount parallels Sinai revelation
- Feeding miracles recall manna in wilderness
- Transfiguration shows Moses with Jesus (Matthew 17:1-8)
- Jesus as new lawgiver: "You have heard... but I say" (Matthew 5:21-48)

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of Moses primarily as:

- Historical leader and lawgiver
- Character in famous stories (burning bush, Red Sea, Ten Commandments)
- Religious figure associated with rules and regulations

Instead, consider Moses as:

- The archetypal prophet-deliverer whose pattern Jesus fulfills
- A mediator whose life embodies the "drawing out" action of his name
- The human face of divine rescue, whose story foreshadows greater redemption
- The foundation for understanding how God works through human instruments

Moses' name isn't just what he was called, but encapsulates his divine mission—to be drawn out himself so he could draw others out from bondage to freedom.
