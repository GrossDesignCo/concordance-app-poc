- Jesus uses the serpent as a positive symbol of wisdom

John 3:14 "As Moses lifted up the **serpent** (τὸν ὄφιν) in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up"

## Patterns

### The Serpent and Divine Judgment

The snake consistently appears as both an agent and object of divine judgment throughout Scripture:

#### As Object of Judgment

Genesis 3:14-15 "The LORD God said to **the-snake**, 'Because you have done this, cursed are you more than all cattle... And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, and you shall bruise him on the heel.'"
- First divine curse in Scripture
- Establishes ongoing conflict
- Prophetic of ultimate defeat

#### As Agent of Judgment

Numbers 21:6 "The LORD sent fiery **snakes** among the people and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died."
- Divine punishment for rebellion
- Physical manifestation of spiritual consequences

Amos 9:3 "Though they conceal themselves from My sight on the floor of the sea, from there I will command **the-snake** and it will bite them."
- No escape from divine judgment
- Snake as instrument of divine will

Jeremiah 8:17 "For behold, I am sending **snakes** against you, Adders, for which there is no charm, And they will bite you."
- Prophetic warning of coming judgment
- Unstoppable nature of divine punishment

#### As Symbol of Judgment Overcome

Numbers 21:8-9 "Then the LORD said to Moses, 'Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard; and it shall come about, that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, he will live.' And Moses made a bronze **snake** and set it on the standard; and it came about, that if a **snake** had bitten any man, when he looked to the bronze **snake**, he lived."
- Judgment transformed into salvation
- Looking at the cause of death brings life
- Typological of Christ (John 3:14-15)

### The Serpent and Wisdom

A complex pattern emerges connecting the serpent with wisdom—both divine wisdom and its counterfeit:

Genesis 3:1 "**And-the-snake** was more crafty (עָרוּם, arum) than any beast of the field"
- Term for craftiness (עָרוּם) is related to wisdom vocabulary
- Suggests perverted wisdom or cunning

Proverbs 23:32 (on wine) "At the last it bites like a **snake** and stings like a viper"
- Wisdom literature using serpent as warning symbol
- Connects deception with dangerous consequences

Matthew 10:16 "Be wise as **serpents** and innocent as doves"
- Jesus redeems the serpent image for positive wisdom
- Suggests strategic thinking without malice

This pattern reveals a biblical tension: the serpent represents both perverted wisdom (Genesis 3) and legitimate strategic thinking (Matthew 10:16), requiring discernment to distinguish between them.

### The Serpent and Salvation

Perhaps the most striking pattern is how the snake becomes a symbol of salvation:

Numbers 21:8-9 "Make a fiery serpent... everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, he will live."
- The very image of judgment becomes the means of deliverance
- Looking at the bronze serpent brings healing

John 3:14-15 "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life."
- Jesus explicitly connects the bronze serpent to his crucifixion
- The symbol of sin and curse becomes the symbol of salvation

2 Kings 18:4 "He also broke in pieces the bronze **snake** that Moses had made, for until those days the sons of Israel burned incense to it"
- The salvation symbol becomes an idol
- Demonstrates how even divine means of grace can be perverted

This pattern reveals a profound theological principle: God often uses the very symbols of judgment and curse as the means of salvation, culminating in Christ becoming a curse on the cross (Galatians 3:13).

## Cultural Context

### Ancient Near Eastern Serpent Symbolism

In the ancient Near East, serpents carried complex and often contradictory symbolism that would have informed the original audience's understanding:

#### Egyptian Context

The uraeus (cobra) adorned Pharaoh's crown as a symbol of royal power and divine protection. The serpent deity Apophis represented chaos and was the enemy of Ra, the sun god. This dual symbolism as both protector and destroyer would have resonated with Israelites who spent generations in Egypt.

#### Mesopotamian Context

In the Epic of Gilgamesh, a snake steals the plant of immortality from the hero, echoing the Genesis theme of the serpent interfering with human access to eternal life. The Babylonian creation myth Enuma Elish features the serpent-like Tiamat as a primordial chaos monster.

#### Canaanite Context

Serpent imagery appeared in Canaanite fertility cults. Bronze and copper serpent figurines have been discovered at archaeological sites in Israel, suggesting the widespread nature of serpent veneration that the biblical narrative consistently opposes.

### Serpent and Divination

The Hebrew root נ-ח-שׁ (n-ch-sh) connects to both the noun "serpent" (נָחָשׁ, nachash) and the verb "to practice divination" (נִחֵשׁ, nichesh). This linguistic connection suggests an ancient association between serpents and divination practices:

Leviticus 19:26 "You shall not eat anything with the blood, nor practice divination (תְנַחֲשׁוּ, tenachashu) or soothsaying."

Genesis 44:5 (regarding Joseph's cup) "Is not this the one from which my lord drinks and which he indeed uses for divination (נַחֵשׁ, nachesh)?"

Numbers 23:23 "For there is no omen (נַחַשׁ, nachash) against Jacob, nor is there any divination against Israel."

This connection would have signaled to ancient readers that the serpent in Genesis 3 was not merely a clever animal but a symbol of forbidden knowledge and divination practices opposed to God's revealed will.

### Agricultural Setting

For an agricultural society, snakes presented both danger and benefit:

- Threat to human life through venomous bites
- Protection of grain stores by controlling rodent populations
- Hidden danger in fields during harvest
- Association with the ground/dust (Genesis 3:14)

This agricultural context helps explain why the serpent made an effective symbol—it was a familiar creature with both beneficial and dangerous qualities, perfectly suited to represent moral ambiguity and deception.

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- Simply a reptile species
- A one-dimensional villain
- A mythological element
- Satan in disguise

Instead, picture:
- A creature representing wisdom perverted
- A symbol with multiple layers of meaning
- A being that speaks truth mixed with lies
- The embodiment of deception that appears most dangerous when partially right

The serpent in Scripture is never merely an animal but serves as a complex symbol of wisdom, temptation, judgment, and—surprisingly—salvation when transformed by divine purpose.
