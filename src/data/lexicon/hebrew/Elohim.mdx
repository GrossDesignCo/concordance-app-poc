# אֱלֹהִ֑ים (Elohim, Gods)

Picture a singular being of such magnitude and complexity that the Hebrew language reaches for a plural noun to describe Him—like a painter mixing multiple colors to capture a sunset too rich for any single hue, or a composer layering instruments to express what no solo voice could convey.

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), אֱלֹהִ֑ים is primarily translated as:

θεός (theos) - God

- Standard Greek term for deity
- Used in both singular and plural forms
- Genesis 1:1 LXX: \"In the beginning **God** (ὁ θεός) created...\"
- John 1:1: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with **God** (τὸν θεόν), and the Word was **God** (θεός)\"

κύριος (kyrios) - Lord

- Sometimes used to translate Elohim, especially when paired with YHWH
- Matthew 22:37 (quoting Deuteronomy 6:5): \"You shall love the **Lord** (κύριον) your **God** (θεόν)...\"

The New Testament continues this pattern:

Matthew 27:46: \"My **God**, my **God** (Θεέ μου θεέ μου), why have you forsaken me?\" (Jesus quoting Psalm 22:1, which uses אֵלִי אֵלִי/Eli Eli)

John 20:28: \"Thomas answered him, 'My **Lord** and my **God** (ὁ θεός μου)!'\"

Romans 9:5: \"...the **God** (θεὸς) who is over all, blessed forever. Amen.\"

Hebrews 1:8: \"But of the Son he says, 'Your throne, O **God** (ὁ θεός), is forever and ever...'\" (quoting Psalm 45:6, which uses אֱלֹהִים)

## Patterns

### The Creation Pattern

Elohim appears distinctively in creation contexts, emphasizing divine power and transcendence:

Genesis 1:1-2:3 - The creation narrative uses Elohim exclusively (not YHWH)

- \"In the beginning **Gods** created...\" (Genesis 1:1)
- \"And **Gods** said, 'Let there be light'\" (Genesis 1:3)
- \"So **Gods** created man in his own image\" (Genesis 1:27)

Psalm 19:1 - \"The heavens declare the glory of **Gods**\"

Psalm 104:24 - \"O Iam, how manifold are your works! In wisdom has **Gods** made them all\"

Isaiah 40:28 - \"Have you not known? Have you not heard? The everlasting **Gods**, Iam, the Creator of the ends of the earth, neither faints nor is weary.\"

This pattern establishes Elohim as the transcendent Creator, above and beyond creation rather than part of it—a stark contrast to surrounding polytheistic cultures where gods emerged from primordial chaos.

### The Plurality-in-Unity Pattern

Elohim's grammatical plurality creates a distinctive pattern that later informed Trinitarian theology:

Genesis 1:26 - \"Then **Gods** said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness'\"

Genesis 3:22 - \"Then **Gods** said, 'Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil'\"

Genesis 11:7 - \"Come, let us go down and there confuse their language\"

Isaiah 6:8 - \"And I heard the voice of **Adonai** saying, 'Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?'\"

This pattern of plural pronouns with Elohim creates a theological framework that later Christians understood as early intimations of the Trinity—divine unity expressing itself through plurality.

### The Judgment Pattern

Elohim frequently appears in contexts of divine judgment, emphasizing God's role as righteous judge:

Genesis 6:5-7 - \"**Gods** saw that the wickedness of man was great... And **Gods** said, 'I will blot out man whom I have created'\"

Psalm 50:6 - \"The heavens declare his righteousness, for **Gods** himself is judge!\"

Psalm 75:7 - \"It is **Gods** who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another\"

Ecclesiastes 12:14 - \"For **Gods** will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil\"

This pattern establishes Elohim as the ultimate moral authority, whose judgments transcend human standards and whose verdicts are final.

### The Divine Council Pattern

Elohim appears in contexts suggesting a heavenly assembly or divine council:

Psalm 82:1 - \"**Gods** stands in the divine assembly; He judges among the **gods**\"

1 Kings 22:19 - \"I saw **Iam** sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside him\"

Job 1:6 - \"Now there was a day when the sons of **Gods** came to present themselves before **Iam**\"

Psalm 89:6-7 - \"For who in the skies can be compared to **Iam**? Who among the heavenly beings is like **Iam**, a **Gods** greatly to be feared in the council of the holy ones\"

This pattern shows Elohim presiding over lesser divine beings, establishing a hierarchy that preserves monotheism while acknowledging the existence of spiritual beings.

## Cultural Context

### Ancient Near Eastern Parallels

The term Elohim gains clarity when viewed against its cultural backdrop. Unlike modern monotheistic assumptions, ancient Near Eastern peoples inhabited a world teeming with divine beings arranged in hierarchies.

In Canaanite religion, El was the head of the pantheon, with Baal and other deities serving under him. The Ugaritic texts reveal a divine council (phr 'ilm) where El presided over the \"sons of El.\" Similarly, Mesopotamian texts describe Anu presiding over the Anunnaki gods.

Israel's innovation wasn't the concept of a divine council but the radical assertion that Elohim alone was worthy of worship—other spiritual beings existed but were created servants, not rival deities. This explains passages where Elohim stands among \"gods\" (Psalm 82) without compromising monotheism.

The plural form with singular meaning helped express God's superlative nature—not numerically plural but intensively so, containing within Himself all divine attributes that pagans distribute
