# יְהוָה (YHWH, He_Who_Is)

Picture a name so sacred it was rarely spoken aloud, yet so intimate it appears over 6,800 times in Scripture—a name that simultaneously conveys eternal self-existence and covenantal presence, like a burning bush that is never consumed yet draws near to those in need.

## Root

י-ה-ו-ה (Y-H-W-H) - To be/exist/become

Closest English mapping: "He_Who_Is", indicating self-existent being who causes all other existence.

The name appears to be related to the Hebrew verb הָיָה (hayah, "to be"). In Exodus 3:14, God reveals himself as אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה (ehyeh asher ehyeh, "I AM WHO I AM"), with YHWH being the third-person form of this declaration.

## In-Context

The name appears in numerous contexts throughout Scripture, each revealing different aspects of God's character and relationship with His people:

Genesis 2:4 "These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that **He_Who_Is** God made the earth and the heavens."

Exodus 3:15 "God also said to Moses, 'Say this to the people of Israel: "**He_Who_Is**, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you." This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.'"

Exodus 6:2-3 "God spoke to Moses and said to him, 'I am **He_Who_Is**. I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name **He_Who_Is** I did not make myself known to them.'"

Exodus 34:6-7 "**He_Who_Is** passed before him and proclaimed, '**He_Who_Is**, **He_Who_Is**, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty...'"

Deuteronomy 6:4 "Hear, O Israel: **He_Who_Is** our God, **He_Who_Is** is one."

Isaiah 42:8 "I am **He_Who_Is**; that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to carved idols."

Psalm 23:1 "**He_Who_Is** is my shepherd; I shall not want."

Malachi 3:6 "For I **He_Who_Is** do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed."

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), YHWH is typically translated as:

κύριος (kyrios) - Lord
- Basic meaning: master, owner, authority
- Standard Greek translation of YHWH
- "The **Lord** said to my Lord..." (Psalm 110:1 LXX)

This translation practice influenced New Testament usage, where kyrios becomes the standard way to refer to both God the Father and Jesus Christ:

Matthew 22:44 (quoting Psalm 110:1) "The **Lord** said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand...'"

Romans 10:13 (quoting Joel 2:32) "Everyone who calls on the name of the **Lord** will be saved."

Philippians 2:11 "...and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is **Lord**, to the glory of God the Father."

Revelation 1:8 "'I am the Alpha and the Omega,' says the **Lord** God, 'who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.'"

This application of YHWH texts to Jesus in the New Testament forms a crucial part of early Christian understanding of Christ's divinity.

## Patterns & Themes

### The Revelation Pattern

YHWH appears in key passages where God progressively reveals Himself to His people:

**Patriarchal Period**
- Genesis 12:1 "**He_Who_Is** said to Abram, 'Go from your country...'"
- Genesis 15:7 "I am **He_Who_Is** who brought you out from Ur"
- Genesis 28:13 "I am **He_Who_Is**, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac"

**Mosaic Revelation**
- Exodus 3:14-15 "God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM'... 'Say this to the people of Israel: **He_Who_Is**... has sent me to you'"
- Exodus 6:2-3 "I am **He_Who_Is**. I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name **He_Who_Is** I did not make myself known to them"
- Exodus 34:5-7 "**He_Who_Is** descended in the cloud... proclaimed the name of **He_Who_Is**"

**Prophetic Expansion**
- Isaiah 42:8 "I am **He_Who_Is**; that is my name"
- Jeremiah 33:2 "Thus says **He_Who_Is** who made the earth, **He_Who_Is** who formed it to establish it"
- Ezekiel 36:23 "The nations will know that I am **He_Who_Is**"

This pattern shows YHWH's name being progressively revealed and understood throughout Israel's history, culminating in the New Testament revelation of Jesus as the embodiment of YHWH's presence.

### The Covenant Formula Pattern

YHWH appears in a distinct covenant formula throughout Scripture:

**Basic Formula**
- "I will be your God, and you shall be my people"
- Leviticus 26:12 "I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people"
- Jeremiah 7:23 "I will be your God, and you shall be my people"
- Ezekiel 36:28 "You shall be my people, and I will be your God"

**Extended to Nations**
- Zechariah 2:11 "Many nations shall join themselves to **He_Who_Is** in that day, and shall be my people"
- Revelation 21:3 "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man... they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God"

This pattern emphasizes YHWH's covenant relationship, showing that His name is fundamentally connected to His commitment to His people.

### The "I AM" Pattern

YHWH's self-revelation as "I AM" (אֶהְיֶה, ehyeh) in Exodus 3:14 connects to Jesus' "I am" statements in John's Gospel:

**Old Testament Foundation**
- Exodus 3:14 "God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM'"
- Isaiah 41:4 "I, **He_Who_Is**, the first, and with the last; I am he"
- Isaiah 43:10 "Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me"

**New Testament Fulfillment**
- John 8:58 "Before Abraham was, I am"
- John 8:24 "Unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins"
- John 18:5-6 "Jesus said to them, 'I am he'... When he said to them, 'I am he,' they drew back and fell to the ground"

This pattern reveals Jesus as the embodiment of YHWH's "I AM" presence, a claim his opponents recognized as divine self-identification.

### The Divine Warrior Pattern

YHWH is frequently portrayed as a divine warrior fighting on behalf of His people:

**Exodus**
- Exodus 14:14 "**He_Who_Is** will fight for you, and you have only to be silent"
- Exodus 15:3 "**He_Who_Is** is a man of war; **He_Who_Is** is his name"

**Conquest**
- Joshua 10:14 "**He_Who_Is** fought for Israel"
- Joshua 23:3 "**He_Who_Is** your God has fought for you"

**Prophetic Literature**
- Isaiah 42:13 "**He_Who_Is** goes out like a mighty man, like a man of war he stirs up his zeal"
- Zechariah 14:3 "Then **He_Who_Is** will go out and fight against those nations"

**Apocalyptic Culmination**
- Revelation 19:11-16 "In righteousness he judges and makes war... and his name is called The Word of God"

This pattern shows YHWH as actively engaged in history, fighting to establish His kingdom and deliver His people.

## Cultural Context

### The Unpronounceable Name

In ancient Israelite practice, YHWH was considered too sacred to pronounce in everyday speech. This practice, known as the Kethib-Qere (written-spoken) distinction, led to several important cultural practices:

- When encountering YHWH in the text, readers would substitute Adonai ("Lord")
- This practice led to the vowel pointing of YHWH with Adonai's vowels, creating the hybrid form "Jehovah" in later European translations
- By the Second Temple period, only the High Priest would pronounce the name, and only on Yom Kippur
- This reverence reflects Exodus 20:7, "You shall not take the name of **He_Who_Is** your God in vain"

For ancient Israelites, this wasn't mere superstition but profound reverence—the name contained the very essence of God's being and was too powerful for casual use.

### Names and Identity

In ancient Near Eastern culture, names carried far greater significance than in modern Western society:

- Names revealed essential character and destiny
- Changing a name (as God did with Abram→Abraham) signified a fundamental change in identity and purpose
- Knowing someone's name implied a level of power or authority in relation to them
- Giving your name to someone established a relationship

When God revealed His name as YHWH, He wasn't simply providing a label but inviting Israel into a unique relationship with His very essence. This explains why God's self-revelation at the burning bush was so momentous—He was making Himself knowable and accessible in an unprecedented way.

### Contrast with Other Deities

YHWH stood in stark contrast to the deities of surrounding nations:

- Egyptian gods had secret names that gave magical power when known
- Mesopotamian gods had names derived from natural forces or celestial bodies
- Canaanite deities had names describing their domains (Baal = "lord/master")

Unlike these, YHWH's name:
- Emphasized being rather than function
- Suggested self-existence rather than derivation from natural phenomena
- Implied personal presence rather than distant power
- Indicated constancy rather than cyclical patterns

This distinction reinforced Israel's unique monotheism in a polytheistic world. While other nations worshipped gods who personified aspects of creation, Israel worshipped the self-existent Creator who transcended creation yet remained intimately involved with it.

### The Name as Presence

For ancient Israelites, YHWH's name represented His actual presence:

- The Tabernacle and Temple were where God "caused His name to dwell" (Deuteronomy 12:11)
- Calling on the name of YHWH meant invoking His actual presence and power
- Blessing in YHWH's name conveyed His actual favor
- The priestly blessing (Numbers 6:24-26) placed YHWH's name upon the people

This explains why the Third Commandment was so serious—misusing God's name wasn't about pronunciation but about falsely claiming His presence or authority.

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- A formal title or designation
- A label for identification
- A sound used for address
- A personal preference

Instead, picture:
- The essence of being itself
- The source from which all existence flows
- A presence that can be experienced but never fully grasped
- A relationship more than a designation

When Moses asked for God's name, he wasn't asking "What should I call you?" but "Who are you in your essence?" The answer—"I AM WHO I AM"—reveals God as the uncaused cause, the ground of all being, whose existence depends on nothing outside Himself.
