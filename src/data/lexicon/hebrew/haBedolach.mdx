# הַבְּדֹלַח (haBedolach, the-Bedolach)

Picture a mysterious, translucent substance—prized for its distinctive appearance and rarity—something so noteworthy that it serves as a reference point for describing both Eden's abundance and heaven's provision.

## Root

בְּדֹלַח (Bedolach) - A precious substance of disputed identity

**Possible etymology:** Connected to בָּדַל (badal) meaning "to separate, divide," suggesting something set apart or distinguished.

**Prefix:** הַ (ha-) - The definite article "the"

**Translation approach:** "the-Bedolach" - preserving both the definite article and the transliterated term, acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding this ancient substance while maintaining its distinctiveness in the text.

## In-Context

**Genesis 2:12** "And the gold of that land is good; **the-Bedolach** and the onyx stone are there."

**Numbers 11:7** "Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like **the-Bedolach**."

These are the only two occurrences of בְּדֹלַח in the Hebrew Bible, each serving as a point of comparison to help readers visualize something unfamiliar through reference to something distinctive and valuable.

## Translation Traditions

Various translation traditions reflect uncertainty about this substance's exact identity:

**Resinous interpretations:**

- "Bdellium" (ESV, NASB, KJV) - Following ancient identification with aromatic tree resin
- "Aromatic resin" (NIV) - Generic descriptive approach

**Mineral interpretations:**

- "Pearl" (some medieval Jewish commentaries)
- "Crystal" or "precious stone" (certain ancient versions)

**Notable absence:** Hebrew lacks dedicated vocabulary for alabaster (unlike Greek ἀλάβαστρον), despite alabaster's prominence in ancient Near Eastern luxury goods. This conspicuous gap raises questions about whether Bedolach might have filled this semantic space for certain translucent, precious substances.

## Related Concepts

**שְׁאֹר** (sheor) - Resin/gum

- General term for plant exudations used practically
- "You shall not burn any **resin** as a food offering to the LORD" (Leviticus 2:11)

**לְבֹנָה** (levonah) - Frankincense

- Specific aromatic resin used in worship, white and translucent
- "Put **frankincense** on it; it is a grain offering" (Leviticus 2:15)

**מֹר** (mor) - Myrrh

- Fragrant resin for perfume and medicine, dark reddish color
- "My hands dripped with **myrrh**" (Song of Solomon 5:5)

**שֹׁהַם** (shoham) - Onyx

- Precious stone mentioned alongside Bedolach in Genesis 2:12
- "**Onyx** stones and setting stones" (Exodus 25:7)

Unlike these clearly identifiable substances, בְּדֹלַח remains enigmatic, apparently valued for both distinctive appearance and rarity, serving as a marker of exceptional quality and divine provision.

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

The Septuagint translators' uncertainty is revealed through their inconsistent renderings:

**Genesis 2:12:** ὁ ἄνθραξ (ho anthrax) - "the carbuncle"

- Emphasizes gem-like visual appearance
- Suggests translucent, possibly reddish stone

**Numbers 11:7:** κρύσταλλος (krystallos) - "crystal"

- Focuses on transparent/translucent quality
- "The appearance of it was as the appearance of **crystal**"

This variation indicates that even ancient translators were uncertain about Bedolach's exact nature, though both translations emphasize distinctive visual properties—translucency, brightness, or crystalline appearance.

## Cultural Context

### Ancient Luxury and Mystery

For ancient readers, Bedolach represented:

**Exotic rarity:** A substance distinctive enough to serve as a standard of comparison, yet mysterious enough that its exact nature was debated even in antiquity.

**Divine geography:** Its placement in Genesis 2:12 among Eden's treasures associates it with God's original, perfect creation—a substance from the primeval world of abundance.

**Sensory distinctiveness:** Whether resinous, mineral, or something else entirely, Bedolach possessed visual qualities striking enough to describe heaven's manna.

**Commercial value:** Listed alongside gold and onyx, representing the intersection of beauty, rarity, and worth.

### The Manna Connection

Numbers 11:7's comparison serves multiple purposes:

**Visual aid:** Helps readers understand manna's distinctive appearance through reference to something recognizably special

**Value statement:** Elevates manna from mere sustenance to something precious and noteworthy

**Creation echo:** Links God's wilderness provision back to Eden's abundance—the same mysterious substance that marked primeval blessing now describes heavenly bread

**Concrete imagery:** Uses specific, tangible reference to communicate divine realities

### Reading Note for Modern Audiences

Rather than viewing Bedolach as merely an obscure biblical reference, consider it as:

- A window into ancient perceptions of rarity and beauty
- Evidence that some of creation's original treasures remain mysterious to us
- A reminder that biblical writers used concrete, sensory details from their world to communicate divine truths
- A substance so distinctive that it bridged the gap between Eden's perfection and wilderness provision

The enduring mystery of Bedolach's exact identity serves the text well—like the manna it describes, it points beyond itself to divine provision that transcends our full comprehension while remaining tangibly real to those who encounter it.
