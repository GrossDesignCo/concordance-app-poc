# וּלְשָׁמְרָהּ (uLeShamrah, and-to-keep-her)

Picture a vigilant gardener, not merely planting but constantly watching over the garden—removing weeds, protecting against pests, maintaining boundaries, and preserving its design and purpose. This is active, protective stewardship that both preserves and defends what has been entrusted.

## Root

### Compound Structure

וּ (u-) + לְ (le-) + שָׁמְרָהּ (shamrah)

#### Prefixes:
- וּ (u-) - "and" (conjunction)
- לְ (le-) - "to/for" (preposition indicating purpose)

#### Main Word: שָׁמְרָהּ (shamrah)
- From root שׁ-מ-ר (sh-m-r) - to guard/keep/watch/preserve
- Verb form: Qal infinitive construct
- Suffix: הּ (-ah) - feminine singular "her/it" (referring to the garden)

Closest English mapping: "and-to-keep-her" - preserving both the conjunction, purpose preposition, and the feminine object reference.

## In-Context

Genesis 2:15 is the only occurrence of this exact form:
"And Iam God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it **and-to-keep-her**."

However, the root שׁמר (shamar) appears frequently throughout Scripture:

Genesis 3:24 "He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword... to guard [לִשְׁמֹר, liShmor] the way to the tree of life."

Genesis 4:9 "Am I my brother's **keeper** [שֹׁמֵר, shomer]?"

Exodus 23:20 "Behold, I send an angel before you to guard [לִשְׁמָרְךָ, liShmarcha] you on the way."

Numbers 6:24 "Iam bless you and **keep** [וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ, veYishmerecha] you."

Deuteronomy 5:12 "Observe [שָׁמוֹר, shamor] the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."

Psalm 121:7 "Iam will **keep** [יִשְׁמָר, yishmar] you from all evil; he will **keep** [יִשְׁמֹר, yishmor] your life."

Proverbs 4:23 "**Keep** [שְׁמֹר, shemor] your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life."

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), וּלְשָׁמְרָהּ in Genesis 2:15 is translated as:

φυλάσσειν (phylassein) - "to guard/keep/protect"

This Greek word appears throughout the New Testament:

Luke 11:28 "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and **keep** [φυλάσσουσιν, phylassousin] it!"

John 12:25 "Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will **keep** [φυλάξει, phylaxei] it for eternal life."

1 Timothy 6:20 "O Timothy, **guard** [φύλαξον, phylaxon] the deposit entrusted to you."

2 Timothy 1:14 "By the Holy Spirit who dwells within us, **guard** [φύλαξον, phylaxon] the good deposit entrusted to you."

Jesus directly connected this concept to covenant keeping:

John 14:15 "If you love me, you will **keep** [τηρήσετε, tērēsete] my commandments."

John 15:10 "If you **keep** [τηρήσητε, tērēsēte] my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have **kept** [τετήρηκα, tetērēka] my Father's commandments and abide in his love."

Note: While the LXX uses φυλάσσω (phylassō) in Genesis 2:15, Jesus often uses τηρέω (tēreō) when speaking of keeping commandments. Both words convey the concept of guarding and preserving, with subtle differences in emphasis.

## Patterns

### Garden-Temple Pattern

The command to "keep" the garden establishes a pattern connecting Eden to later sacred spaces:

**Eden as First Temple**
- Genesis 2:15 "to work it **and-to-keep-her**" - Adam's priestly role
- Genesis 3:24 "to **guard** the way to the tree of life" - Cherubim continue this function

**Tabernacle/Temple Keeping**
- Numbers 3:7-8 "They shall **keep** [וְשָׁמְרוּ, veShamru] guard over him and over the whole congregation... to **keep** [לִשְׁמֹר, liShmor] the charge of the people of Israel."
- Numbers 18:5 "You shall **keep** [וּשְׁמַרְתֶּם, uShemartem] guard over the sanctuary and over the altar."
- 1 Chronicles 23:32 "Thus they were to **keep** [וְשָׁמְרוּ, veShamru] charge of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary."

This pattern reveals Adam's role as the first priest, tasked with maintaining the sanctity and order of God's sacred space.

### Covenant Keeping Pattern

The concept of "keeping" extends beyond physical protection to covenant faithfulness:

**Divine Keeping**
- Genesis 28:15 "Behold, I am with you and will **keep** [וּשְׁמַרְתִּיךָ, uShemartikha] you wherever you go."
- Numbers 6:24 "The LORD bless you and **keep** [וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ, veYishmerekha] you."
- Psalm 121:7-8 "The LORD will **keep** [יִשְׁמָר, yishmar] you from all evil... The LORD will **keep** [יִשְׁמָר, yishmar] your going out and your coming in."

**Human Response**
- Exodus 19:5 "If you will indeed obey my voice and **keep** [וּשְׁמַרְתֶּם, uShemartem] my covenant."
- Deuteronomy 7:9 "Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who **keeps** [שֹׁמֵר, shomer] covenant and steadfast love."
- Psalm 119:44 "I will **keep** [וְאֶשְׁמְרָה, ve'eshmerah] your law continually, forever and ever."

This pattern establishes a reciprocal relationship: God keeps (protects) his people, and they respond by keeping (obeying) his commandments.

### Creation Care Pattern

The command to "keep" the garden establishes humanity's responsibility toward creation:

**Original Mandate**
- Genesis 2:15 "to work it **and-to-keep-her**" - First environmental responsibility

**Extended to Land**
- Leviticus 25:2 "the land shall **keep** [וְשָׁבְתָה, veShavetah] a Sabbath to the LORD." (Note: different Hebrew word but related concept)
- Leviticus 26:34-35 "Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths... it shall rest because it did not rest during your Sabbaths when you were dwelling in it."

**Consequences of Failure**
- Isaiah 24:5-6 "The earth lies defiled under its inhabitants; for they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore a curse devours the earth."

This pattern shows that "keeping" extends beyond the garden to all creation, establishing human responsibility as stewards rather than exploiters.

## Cultural Context

### Agricultural Understanding

For ancient Israelites, the concept of "keeping" a garden would have resonated deeply with their agricultural experience:

- **Boundary Maintenance**: Ancient gardens and fields required clear boundaries marked by walls or hedges to prevent animal intrusion and theft. "Keeping" included maintaining these boundaries.

- **Selective Cultivation**: A keeper distinguishes between crops and weeds, actively removing what doesn't belong. This selective preservation mirrors God's separation of elements in creation.

- **Water Management**: In the arid Near East, garden keeping crucially involved irrigation systems. The keeper ensured water flowed properly, reflecting the rivers of Eden.

- **Seasonal Vigilance**: Different threats required different responses throughout the year—protection from heat in summer, cold in winter, and various pests in different seasons.

### Temple Service Connection

The Hebrew audience would have recognized the parallel between Adam's garden duty and priestly temple service:

- **Sacred Space**: Both garden and temple were understood as sacred spaces where heaven and earth intersect.

- **Ritual Purity**: Just as priests maintained ritual purity in the temple, Adam was to maintain the garden's purity by preventing disorder.

- **Mediatorial Role**: The keeper stands between the sacred space and potential threats, mediating proper access and use.

- **Representational Function**: The priest represented God to people and people to God; similarly, Adam represented God's authority in creation while representing creation before God.

### Covenant Language

The command to "keep" would have been understood within Israel's covenant framework:

- **Reciprocal Obligation**: Just as Israel was to "keep" God's commandments, Adam was to "keep" the garden—both reflecting covenant responsibilities.

- **Relational Not Just Legal**: "Keeping" wasn't merely following rules but maintaining a relationship. The garden keeper maintains relationship with both the garden and its owner.

- **Trust and Delegation**: God entrusting the garden to Adam parallels God entrusting the law to Israel—both acts of divine trust requiring human faithfulness.

- **Consequences of Failure**: Just as breaking covenant had consequences for Israel, Adam's failure to "keep" the garden resulted in expulsion and changed relationship with creation.

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- Simple maintenance or preservation
- Passive ownership ("keeping" a possession)
- Restrictive confinement ("keeping" someone in)
- Basic obedience to rules

Instead, picture:
- A guardian at a gate, vigilantly watching
- A shepherd protecting sheep from predators
- A curator preserving precious artifacts
- A covenant partner faithfully upholding promises

The Hebrew concept of "keeping" combines active protection, faithful preservation, and covenant loyalty—a comprehensive stewardship that both maintains and defends what has been entrusted.
