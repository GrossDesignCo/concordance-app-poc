# הַנְּחָשִׁים (haNechashim, the-serpents)

Picture a deadly swarm of venomous snakes, creatures both feared and symbolically potent in ancient times - slithering silently through camp, bringing sudden death with their bite, and serving as divine instruments of both judgment and healing.

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), הַנְּחָשִׁים is translated as:

ὄφεις (opheis) - serpents

- Numbers 21:6-9 uses this term consistently
- Basic Greek term for snakes
- John 3:14 "And as Moses lifted up the **serpent** (ὄφιν) in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up"
- Matthew 10:16 "Be wise as **serpents** (ὄφεις) and innocent as doves"
- Revelation 12:9 "that ancient **serpent** (ὄφις), who is called the devil and Satan"

The consistent translation shows how the Greek maintained the serpent imagery when referring to both literal snakes and symbolic representations.

Jesus specifically references the bronze serpent incident in John 3:14-15, creating a typological connection between the lifted-up serpent that brought healing and his own crucifixion: "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life."

## Patterns

### Divine Judgment Pattern

Serpents frequently appear as instruments of divine judgment throughout Scripture:

**Genesis Pattern**

- Genesis 3:14 "The LORD God said to the **serpent**, 'Because you have done this, cursed are you...'"
- First divine judgment in Scripture involves a serpent
- Establishes serpent as symbol of temptation/evil

**Wilderness Pattern**

- Numbers 21:6 "Then the LORD sent fiery **the-serpents** among the people"
- Deuteronomy 8:15 "the great and terrifying wilderness, with its fiery **serpents**"
- Judgment specifically for complaining/ingratitude
- Wilderness setting emphasizes vulnerability

**Prophetic Pattern**

- Jeremiah 8:17 "For behold, I am sending among you **serpents**, adders that cannot be charmed"
- Amos 9:3 "I will command **the-serpent**, and it shall bite them"
- Used as metaphor for inescapable judgment
- Often paired with exile/invasion imagery

This pattern shows serpents consistently representing divine punishment that is:
1. Swift and deadly
2. Difficult or impossible to escape
3. Direct consequence of rebellion
4. Often followed by opportunity for repentance

### Serpent-Bronze Wordplay

A significant linguistic pattern appears in the Numbers 21 account through wordplay between similar-sounding Hebrew terms:

- נָחָשׁ (nachash) - serpent
- נְחֹשֶׁת (nechoshet) - bronze/copper
- Numbers 21:9 "So Moses made a נְחַשׁ נְחֹשֶׁת (nachash nechoshet, bronze serpent)"

This wordplay creates a theological connection where:
1. The instrument of judgment (nachash) becomes the instrument of healing
2. The material (nechoshet) sounds like the creature it represents
3. Looking at a representation of the punishment brings salvation

The deliberate phonetic similarity reinforces the paradoxical nature of God's judgment and mercy working through the same symbol.

### Serpent-Satan Connection

Scripture develops a pattern connecting the physical serpent with spiritual evil:

**Eden Narrative**

- Genesis 3:1 "Now the **serpent** was more crafty than any other beast"
- Introduces serpent as deceptive antagonist
- Physical creature with supernatural knowledge

**Prophetic Literature**

- Isaiah 27:1 "In that day... the LORD... will punish Leviathan the fleeing **serpent**"
- Cosmic serpent as enemy of God's order
- Symbolic of spiritual opposition to God's kingdom

**Apocalyptic Culmination**

- Revelation 12:9 "that ancient **serpent**, who is called the devil and Satan"
- Revelation 20:2 "And he seized... the **serpent** of old, who is the devil and Satan"
- Explicit identification of serpent with Satan
- Completes narrative arc begun in Genesis

This pattern shows progressive revelation where the physical serpents of judgment (like those in Numbers 21) connect to a broader spiritual reality of evil and opposition to God.

## Cultural Context

### Ancient Near Eastern Serpent Symbolism

In the ancient Near East, serpents carried complex and often contradictory symbolism that would have informed Israelite understanding:

**Egyptian Context**

- The uraeus (cobra) adorned Pharaoh's crown as symbol of royal power and protection
- Apophis, the giant serpent, represented chaos and threatened cosmic order
- Serpent staffs were symbols of healing and magical power
- Israelites would have been familiar with these Egyptian associations after their time in Egypt

**Canaanite Context**

- Serpent figurines were common in Canaanite household shrines
- Associated with fertility and underground/chthonic powers
- Often connected to goddess worship
- The biblical prohibition against serpent worship directly challenged these practices

**Mesopotamian Context**

- The caduceus-like entwined serpents symbolized healing
- Serpent imagery appeared on boundary stones as protective guardians
- Tiamat (chaos deity) had serpentine associations
- Provided background for cosmic serpent imagery in prophetic literature

### Wilderness Experience

For ancient Israelites, the Numbers 21 account would have resonated with their desert experience:

- Desert vipers were a constant danger during wilderness travel
- Their bites caused painful, burning sensations (hence "fiery serpents")
- No effective treatment existed in ancient times
- Survival from snakebite would be seen as miraculous

The serpent on the pole would have been understood as a powerful reversal - the very creature causing death becoming the symbol bringing life when viewed in faith.

### Bronze Serpent in Israelite History

The bronze serpent's significance extended beyond the wilderness period:

- Preserved as a religious artifact for centuries
- Eventually became object of idolatrous worship (2 Kings 18:4)
- King Hezekiah destroyed it, calling it "Nehushtan" (piece of bronze)
- Demonstrated how even legitimate religious symbols could become idols

This history would have taught Israelites that:
1. God's means of deliverance should never become objects of worship
2. Religious symbols have temporary, not permanent, significance
3. Faith should be in God, not in the symbols themselves

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- Simple biological classification
- Horror movie imagery
- Garden pests
- Symbolic evil only

Instead, picture:
- Deadly creatures bringing swift, painful death
- Divine instruments carrying both judgment and potential healing
- Powerful symbols with complex religious associations
- Concrete reminders of cosmic spiritual realities

The Hebrew understanding of serpents combined biological reality with theological significance in ways that made "the-serpents" not just creatures but carriers of divine message and meaning.
