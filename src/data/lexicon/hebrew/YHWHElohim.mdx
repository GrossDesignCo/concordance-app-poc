# יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים (YHWH Elohim, He_Who_Is Gods)

Picture a king who not only rules with absolute authority but also personally designed and crafted his entire kingdom - a sovereign who is simultaneously transcendent in majesty yet intimately involved with his subjects. This compound name reveals God as both the utterly unique, self-existent One and the supreme Creator-Ruler of all things.

## Root

### Compound Structure

יְהוָה (YHWH) + אֱלֹהִים (Elohim)

#### First Component: יְהוָה (YHWH)

- From root ה-י-ה (h-y-h) - to be/exist/become
- Form suggests causative meaning: "He who causes to be"
- Often connected to Exodus 3:14 "I AM WHO I AM" (אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה)
- Personal, covenant name of God
- Considered too sacred to pronounce in later Jewish tradition

#### Second Component: אֱלֹהִים (Elohim)

- From root א-ל-ה (ʾ-l-h) - indicating power/might
- Plural form of אֱלוֹהַּ (Eloah)
- Used for God of Israel, false gods, and occasionally human authorities
- Carries connotations of power, authority, and creative ability

Closest English mapping: "He_Who_Is Gods" - preserving both the personal name element and the plural form with its implications of fullness and majesty.

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים is typically translated as:

κύριος ὁ θεός (kyrios ho theos) - "Lord the God"

- Genesis 2:8 "καὶ ἐφύτευσεν κύριος ὁ θεὸς παράδεισον" ("And **Lord the God** planted a paradise")
- The article (ὁ) distinguishes this from other uses of kyrios

This Greek rendering influenced New Testament usage:

- Revelation 1:8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega, says **the Lord God** (κύριος ὁ θεός)"
- Luke 1:32 "**The Lord God** (κύριος ὁ θεός) will give to him the throne of his father David"

Jesus himself used this formulation when quoting Deuteronomy 6:5:
- Matthew 22:37 "You shall love **the Lord your God** (κύριον τὸν θεόν σου) with all your heart..."

The New Testament preserves the distinction between:
- κύριος (kyrios) alone - translating YHWH
- θεός (theos) alone - translating Elohim
- κύριος ὁ θεός (kyrios ho theos) - translating the compound YHWH Elohim

## Patterns

### The Eden Pattern

The compound name יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים appears with striking concentration in Genesis 2-3, establishing a pattern of intimate divine-human relationship:

**Key Characteristics:**
- Personal formation of humanity (Genesis 2:7)
- Direct communication with humans (Genesis 2:16)
- Provision for human needs (Genesis 2:9)
- Physical presence "walking in the garden" (Genesis 3:8)
- Seeking relationship despite human failure (Genesis 3:9)
- Judgment tempered with mercy (Genesis 3:21)

This pattern creates a theological framework where God is simultaneously the transcendent Creator (Elohim) and the personally engaged covenant partner (YHWH).

The Eden pattern reappears in key covenant renewal moments:
- Sinai covenant (Exodus 19-24)
- Davidic covenant (2 Samuel 7)
- New covenant prophecies (Jeremiah 31:31-34)

### The Prophet-Messenger Pattern

יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים frequently introduces prophetic oracles, establishing divine authority:

**Formula Structure:**
"Thus says יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים..."

**Key Examples:**
- Exodus 9:1 "Thus says **He_Who_Is Gods** of the Hebrews: 'Let my people go...'"
- 2 Samuel 7:5 "Thus says **He_Who_Is Gods**: 'Would you build me a house to dwell in?'"
- Isaiah 7:7 "Thus says **He_Who_Is Gods**: 'It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass.'"
- Ezekiel 2:4 "Thus says **He_Who_Is Gods**..."

This pattern emphasizes that prophetic messages carry both:
- The personal authority of the covenant name (YHWH)
- The universal sovereign authority of the creator (Elohim)

### The Worship Response Pattern

יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים appears in contexts where proper worship response is emphasized:

**Key Examples:**
- Genesis 4:26 "At that time people began to call upon the name of **He_Who_Is Gods**"
- Exodus 32:5 "Tomorrow shall be a feast to **He_Who_Is Gods**"
- 1 Chronicles 16:36 "Blessed be **He_Who_Is Gods**, the God of Israel"
- Psalm 84:11 "For **He_Who_Is Gods** is a sun and shield"

This pattern establishes that true worship acknowledges both:
- God's personal, covenant relationship (YHWH)
- God's supreme authority and power (Elohim)

## Cultural Context

### Divine Names in the Ancient Near East

For ancient Israelites, the compound name יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים would have carried profound theological significance against the backdrop of surrounding polytheistic cultures:

**Egyptian Context:**
- Multiple deities with specialized domains (Ra for sun, Osiris for afterlife)
- Names revealed specific functions and limitations
- Contrast: יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים combines personal relationship with universal sovereignty

**Mesopotamian Context:**
- Pantheons with hierarchical structures (Anu, Enlil, Marduk)
- Divine names connected to cosmic functions and cities
- Contrast: יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים unites national covenant with universal creation

**Canaanite Context:**
- El as head of pantheon with Baal as storm deity
- Names reflected natural forces and geographical features
- Contrast: יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים claims both El's authority and personal engagement

### Covenant and Creation

The combination of names bridged two fundamental theological concepts:

**Creation Theology (Elohim):**
- Universal sovereignty
- Natural order
- Divine transcendence
- Applies to all humanity

**Covenant Theology (YHWH):**
- Particular relationship
- Moral order
- Divine immanence
- Applies specially to Israel

For ancient hearers, this compound name declared that the God who created all things was the same God who entered into covenant relationship with Israel - a radical theological claim in the ancient world.

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- Abstract theological concepts
- Formal religious terminology
- Different "aspects" of God
- Mere synonyms or literary variation

Instead, picture:
- A king who personally knows each citizen by name
- A father who is also the supreme judge
- A creator who walks among his creation
- The universal sovereign who makes specific promises

The compound name יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים reminds us that the God of Israel is simultaneously the utterly unique, self-existent One and the supreme Creator-Ruler of all things - both transcendent in majesty and intimately involved with his creation.
