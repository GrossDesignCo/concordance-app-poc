## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), הָא֖וֹר is primarily translated as:

φῶς (phōs) - light

- Genesis 1:3-5 "καὶ εἶδεν ὁ θεὸς **τὸ φῶς** ὅτι καλόν" ("And God saw **the light** that it was good")
- This term becomes central in New Testament theology

This same Greek word appears prominently in the New Testament:

John 1:4-5 "In him was life, and the life was **the light** (τὸ φῶς) of men. **The light** shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."

John 8:12 "I am **the light** (τὸ φῶς) of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have **the light** of life."

Matthew 5:14 "You are **the light** (τὸ φῶς) of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden."

1 John 1:5 "God is **light** (φῶς), and in him is no darkness at all."

Revelation 22:5 "And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their **light** (φωτιεῖ, from φῶς)."

The consistent use of φῶς in both the Greek Old and New Testaments creates a theological bridge, allowing New Testament authors to build directly on the light imagery established in the Hebrew Scriptures.

## Patterns & Themes

### Creation Pattern

Light appears as the first created element, establishing a pattern that shapes all biblical theology of illumination:

Genesis 1:3-5 "And God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light. And God saw **the-light**, that it was good."

2 Corinthians 4:6 "For God, who said, 'Let **light** shine out of darkness,' has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."

Psalm 33:9 "For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm."

John 1:1-5 "In the beginning was the Word... In him was life, and the life was **the light** of men."

This pattern establishes several key principles:
- Light precedes all other creation
- Light comes through divine speech
- Light is explicitly declared "good"
- Light operates by divine separation from darkness
- Light receives divine naming ("Day")

The creation of light establishes a theological framework where illumination is:
1. Primordial (first in sequence)
2. Fundamental (necessary for all else)
3. Verbal (spoken into existence)
4. Evaluative (explicitly good)
5. Divisive (separates day from night)
6. Definitive (establishes categories)

### Salvation as Illumination

Throughout Scripture, salvation is consistently portrayed through light imagery:

Isaiah 9:2 "The people who walked in darkness have seen a great **light**; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has **light** shined."

Psalm 27:1 "IAM is my **light** and my salvation; whom shall I fear?"

Micah 7:8-9 "When I sit in darkness, IAM will be **a-light** to me... He will bring me out to **the light**; I shall look upon his vindication."

John 8:12 "I am **the light** of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have **the light** of life."

Acts 26:18 "To open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to **light** and from the power of Satan to God."

Ephesians 5:8 "For at one time you were darkness, but now you are **light** in the Lord. Walk as children of **light**."

This pattern reveals salvation as:
1. Transition from darkness to light
2. Divine illumination of human darkness
3. Ongoing walking in light
4. Both divine gift and human responsibility

### Light as Divine Presence

Light frequently serves as a manifestation of God's presence:

Exodus 13:21 "And IAM went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them **light**."

Psalm 104:2 "Covering yourself with **light** as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent."

Habakkuk 3:4 "His brightness was like **the light**; rays flashed from his hand; and there he veiled his power."

1 Timothy 6:16 "Who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable **light**, whom no one has ever seen or can see."

Revelation 21:23 "And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it **light**, and its lamp is the Lamb."

This pattern establishes:
1. Light as divine self-revelation
2. Light as God's chosen medium of guidance
3. Light as both revealing and concealing divine glory
4. Light as eschatological fulfillment

### Light vs. Darkness Dualism

Scripture establishes a consistent moral dualism through light/darkness imagery:

Job 24:13-17 "There are those who rebel against **the light**, who are not acquainted with its ways... The murderer rises before it is **light**... For deep darkness is morning to all of them."

Psalm 112:4 "**Light** dawns in the darkness for the upright; he is gracious, merciful, and righteous."

Proverbs 4:18-19 "The path of the righteous is like **the light** of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day. The way of the wicked is like deep darkness."

Isaiah 5:20 "Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for **light** and **light** for darkness."

John 3:19-21 "And this is the judgment: **the light** has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than **the light** because their works were evil."

1 John 1:5-7 "God is **light**, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie... But if we walk in **the light**, as he is in **the light**, we have fellowship with one another."

This dualism establishes:
1. Moral categories through natural phenomena
2. Ethical choices as movement toward or away from light
3. Divine nature as pure light without darkness
4. Human responsibility to align with light

### Light as Knowledge and Wisdom

Light consistently symbolizes understanding, wisdom, and revelation:

Psalm 19:8 "The commandment of IAM is pure, enlightening the eyes."

Psalm 119:105 "Your word is a lamp to my feet and **a-light** to my path."

Psalm 119:130 "The unfolding of your words gives **light**; it imparts understanding to the simple."

Proverbs 6:23 "For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching **a light**."

2 Peter 1:19 "You will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts."

This pattern reveals:
1. Divine instruction as illuminating
2. Scripture as light-giving
3. Wisdom as progressive illumination
4. Understanding as spiritual sight

## Cultural Context

### Ancient Near Eastern Light Symbolism

In the ancient Near East, light carried profound symbolic significance beyond mere illumination:

#### Practical Realities

Without modern artificial lighting, ancient people experienced darkness more profoundly than we do today. Nighttime brought:
- Vulnerability to predators and enemies
- Cessation of most productive work
- Psychological uncertainty and fear
- Dependence on limited fire/lamp light

This practical reality made light imagery especially powerful in communicating:
- Security and protection
- Productivity and opportunity
- Clarity and certainty
- Divine provision and guidance

#### Religious Context

Unlike surrounding cultures that often worshiped the sun, moon, and stars as deities, Genesis deliberately presents light as God's creation, not a deity itself. This theological distinction is crucial:

- Egyptian religion centered on Ra, the sun god
- Mesopotamian worship included Shamash (sun) and Sin (moon)
- Canaanite pantheon featured Shapash, the sun goddess

Genesis subverts these by:
1. Creating light before celestial bodies (Gen 1:3 vs. 1:14-19)
2. Avoiding terms that might suggest deity
3. Presenting luminaries as mere "light-bearers"
4. Emphasizing their function rather than their essence

This desacralization of light while maintaining its theological significance represents a revolutionary concept in ancient thought.

### Hebrew Light Metaphors

The Hebrew understanding of light extended through several interconnected domains:

#### Life and Death

Light represented vitality and existence itself:
- "The light of life" (Job 33:30)
- "The land of the living" contrasted with Sheol's darkness
- Extinguishing light as metaphor for death (Job 18:5-6)

#### Justice and Righteousness

Light symbolized moral order and justice:
- "Light is sown for the righteous" (Psalm 97:11)
- "Your righteousness like the noonday" (Psalm 37:6)
- "The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn" (Proverbs 4:18)

#### Divine Favor

Light indicated blessing and divine approval:
- "The light of your face" (Psalm 4:6)
- "Make his face shine upon you" (Numbers 6:25)
- "IAM is God, and he has made his light to shine upon us" (Psalm 118:27)

#### Knowledge and Revelation

Light represented understanding and divine disclosure:
- "In your light we see light" (Psalm 36:9)
- "Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things" (Psalm 119:18)
- "The unfolding of your words gives light" (Psalm 119:130)

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- Functional illumination (flipping a light switch)
- Scientific phenomenon (photons, electromagnetic spectrum)
- Metaphorical enlightenment (intellectual understanding)
- Decorative or aesthetic element (mood lighting)

Instead, picture:
- The first dawn breaking over a world that has never known day
- A torch suddenly illuminating a pitch-black cave
- The life-giving warmth of sunrise after a freezing night
- The revealing beam that exposes what was hidden

For ancient Hebrews, light wasn't merely functional but foundational—the primary metaphor for life, revelation, and divine presence. When Scripture speaks of light, it invokes not just visibility but the entire complex of creation, revelation, salvation, and divine glory that makes all other seeing possible.
