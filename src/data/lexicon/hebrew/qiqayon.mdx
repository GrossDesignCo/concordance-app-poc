# קִיקָיוֹן (Qiqayon, luscious_plant)

Picture a rapidly growing, broad-leaved plant that springs up overnight, providing generous shade in the scorching desert sun—a plant so luxuriant and unexpected it seems almost miraculous, yet equally susceptible to sudden destruction.

## Root

קִיקָיוֹן (qiqayon) - Origin uncertain, possibly from an Assyrian or Egyptian loanword

Closest English mapping: "luscious_plant", indicating a plant characterized by rapid growth, broad leaves, and temporary but substantial shade.

## In-Context

The term קִיקָיוֹן appears exclusively in the book of Jonah, chapter 4, where it plays a central role in God's object lesson to the prophet:

Jonah 4:6 "And the LORD God appointed a **luscious_plant**, and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the **luscious_plant**."

Jonah 4:7 "But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the **luscious_plant**, so that it withered."

Jonah 4:9 "But God said to Jonah, 'Is it right for you to be angry about the **luscious_plant**?' And he said, 'Yes, angry enough to die.'"

Jonah 4:10 "Then the LORD said, 'You are concerned about the **luscious_plant**, for which you did not labor and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night.'"

## Greek/Septuagint Usage

In the Septuagint (LXX), קִיקָיוֹן is translated as:

κολοκύνθη (kolokynthē) - "gourd"

- This term typically referred to a gourd or pumpkin-like plant
- The term appears only in Jonah 4 in the LXX
- Does not appear in the New Testament

This translation choice suggests the Greek translators understood the קִיקָיוֹן to be a type of gourd plant, known for rapid growth and broad leaves.

## Cultural Context

### Botanical Identification

While the exact identity of the קִיקָיוֹן remains uncertain, several plants have been proposed:

1. **Castor Oil Plant (Ricinus communis)**
   - Fast-growing shrub reaching 10-15 feet
   - Large, palm-shaped leaves providing ample shade
   - Native to Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East
   - Known in ancient Egypt as "kiki"
   - This identification is supported by Jerome's translation (Latin Vulgate)

2. **Bottle Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria)**
   - Rapid-growing vine with large leaves
   - Commonly trained on structures for shade
   - Widespread throughout ancient Near East
   - Supported by the Septuagint translation

3. **Egyptian Cucumber (Cucumis chate)**
   - Vine with large leaves
   - Grows rapidly in hot conditions
   - Common in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia

The castor plant (Ricinus communis) remains the most likely candidate, as it matches the description's key elements: rapid growth, substantial shade, and vulnerability to pests.

### Agricultural Knowledge

For ancient Near Eastern readers, the קִיקָיוֹן would evoke several important agricultural realities:

1. **Shade as Precious Resource**
   - In the scorching Mesopotamian climate, shade was life-saving
   - Temporary shade structures were common for travelers and workers
   - Natural shade was particularly valued

2. **Plant Vulnerability**
   - Agricultural success was precarious
   - Pests could destroy crops overnight
   - The sudden death of the plant would be a familiar experience

3. **Unearned Provision**
   - The contrast between cultivated crops (requiring labor) and the spontaneous קִיקָיוֹן
   - God's point about undeserved grace would resonate with agricultural communities

### Symbolic Significance

Within the Jonah narrative, the קִיקָיוֹן functions as a powerful teaching tool:

1. **Temporary Comfort**
   - Like Jonah's shade, Nineveh's reprieve was God's gift
   - Both plant and city existed by divine appointment

2. **Misplaced Attachment**
   - Jonah's concern for a plant versus human lives
   - The prophet's priorities revealed through his attachment to temporary comfort

3. **Divine Sovereignty**
   - God who "appointed" (מָנָה, manah) both the plant and the worm
   - Same verb used for God's appointing of the fish (Jonah 1:17), the plant (4:6), the worm (4:7), and the wind (4:8)
   - Demonstrates God's control over all creation for His purposes

4. **Growth Without Labor**
   - "Which you did not labor for and did not cause to grow" (4:10)
   - Parallels God's concern for Nineveh, which He cultivated without Jonah's help

### Reading Note for English Readers

Modern readers might think of:
- Decorative houseplants
- Carefully cultivated garden specimens
- Plants that require constant care

Instead, picture:
- A plant appearing almost miraculously overnight
- Providing life-saving shade in desert conditions
- Growing without human intervention
- Vulnerable to sudden destruction

The קִיקָיוֹן serves as both literal plant and powerful metaphor—a living object lesson about God's sovereignty, mercy, and the proper perspective on what truly matters.
