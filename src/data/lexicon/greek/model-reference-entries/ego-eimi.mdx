# **ἐγώ εἰμι (Ego Eimi, I-am)**

Picture a speaker who steps forward, points to themselves, and declares their presence and identity with absolute authority — not merely stating a fact but revealing their very essence. This phrase functions as both simple identification and profound self-revelation, carrying echoes of divine presence that reverberate through Scripture's most significant moments of self-disclosure.

## **Components**

### **ἐγώ (ego)**

- First-person singular personal pronoun: "I"
- Emphatic form (the non-emphatic form would omit the pronoun entirely)
- Derives from Proto-Indo-European \*éǵh₂ ("I")
- Pronunciation emphasizes the speaker's presence and identity

### **εἰμί (eimi)**

- First-person singular present indicative of verb "to be": "am"
- From Proto-Indo-European \*h₁ésmi ("I am, I exist")
- Basic meaning: to exist, to be present, to be identical with
- Present tense indicates continuous, ongoing state of being

Closest English mapping: "I-am" — preserving both the emphatic personal pronoun and the simple present state of being, while maintaining the compound nature through hyphenation.

## **In-Context**

The phrase appears in two distinct but related contexts in the New Testament: conventional identification and divine self-revelation. We consistently translate it as "I-am" to help readers recognize how these uses are connected in the original Greek.

### **Conventional Usage**

John 9:9 "[The blind man] kept saying, "**I-am** [the one]."

Acts 10:21 "Peter went down to the men and said, "Behold, **I-am** the one you are seeking."

Luke 22:70 "Are you the Son of God, then?" And he said to them, "You say that **I-am**."

### **Divine Self-Revelation**

John 8:58 "Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, **I-am**."

John 8:24 "I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that **I-am**, you will die in your sins."

John 18:5-6 "They answered him, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' Jesus said to them, '**I-am**.' Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When Jesus said to them '**I-am**,' they drew back and fell to the ground."

Mark 6:50 "For they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, 'Take heart; **I-am**. Do not be afraid.'"

John 6:20 "But he said to them, '**I-am**; do not be afraid.'"

Note: While using "I-am" consistently may sound incomplete in English (where we expect "I am [something]"), it preserves the profound ambiguity of the Greek, where Jesus often uses the phrase absolutely, without a predicate.

## **Related Concepts**

### **ἐγώ εἰμι + Predicate**

- Extended form where "I am" is followed by a metaphor or title
- John 6:35 "**I-am** the bread of life"
- John 8:12 "**I-am** the light of the world"
- John 10:11 "**I-am** the good shepherd"
- John 11:25 "**I-am** the resurrection and the life"
- John 14:6 "**I-am** the way, and the truth, and the life"
- John 15:1 "**I-am** the true vine"

Unlike the absolute use, these instances include predicates that metaphorically explain aspects of Jesus' identity and mission.

### **אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה (Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh)**

- Hebrew declaration from Exodus 3:14: "I AM WHO I AM"
- God's self-revelation to Moses at the burning bush
- Connected to the divine name YHWH
- The foundational text echoed in Jesus' "I-am" declarations

### **ἀνά (ana) and ἐγείρω (egeirō)**

- "Rise up" or "stand up" - used for resurrection
- Phonetically similar but etymologically distinct
- Sometimes used in proximity to ego eimi
- "I have risen" contrasts with the eternal "I-am"

### **ὁ ὤν (ho ōn)**

- "The one who is" or "the being one"
- Related participial form of the verb "to be"
- Used in Revelation 1:8 for divine self-description
- Connects to Exodus 3:14 in Septuagint translation

Unlike these expressions, ἐγώ εἰμι (ego eimi) uniquely combines:

1. First-person declaration (personal)
2. Present continuous being (immediate)
3. Potential absence of predicate (absolute)
4. Connection to divine name (transcendent)

## **Translation Notes**

Standard English translations vary:

- "I am" (most common, but loses the emphatic nature)
- "I am he" (adds "he" when no predicate exists in Greek)
- "It is I" (in contexts of identification)
- "I AM" (capitalized to suggest divine significance)

We render ἐγώ εἰμι as "I-am" to preserve several key features:

1. The hyphen connects the two words, reflecting their unified function in Greek
2. The simplicity mirrors the starkness of the Greek declaration
3. The consistency allows readers to see connections between different contexts
4. The form works in both predicate and absolute statements

## **Common Misunderstandings**

- Often mistranslated with added words ("I am he") that aren't in the Greek
- The emphatic nature of using ἐγώ (when it could be omitted) is frequently missed
- The connection to Exodus 3:14 is sometimes overlooked in conventional contexts
- The profound impact of the absolute use (without predicate) is often diminished
- The distinction between identity statements and existence statements is blurred

## **Hebrew Background in Septuagint**

In the Septuagint (LXX), the crucial background comes from Exodus 3:14:

Hebrew: אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה (Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh)
LXX Greek: Ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν (Ego eimi ho ōn)

- Literally: "I-am the being one"
- God's self-revelation to Moses
- Foundation for divine name (YHWH)
- Connected to Jesus' "I-am" statements

Other significant Septuagint uses:

Deuteronomy 32:39: ἐγώ εἰμι καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν θεὸς πλὴν ἐμοῦ

- "I-am, and there is no god beside me"
- Divine uniqueness declaration

Isaiah 41:4: ἐγώ εἰμι πρῶτος καὶ εἰς τὰ ἐπερχόμενα ἐγώ εἰμι

- "I-am first, and I-am into the coming things"
- Divine eternality declaration

Isaiah 43:10: ἵνα γνῶτε καὶ πιστεύσητε καὶ συνῆτε ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι

- "That you may know and believe and understand that I-am"
- Divine recognition declaration

Isaiah 43:25: ἐγώ εἰμι ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ἐξαλείφων τὰς ἀνομίας σου

- "I-am, I-am the one wiping away your lawlessness"
- Doubled for emphasis, divine forgiveness declaration

Isaiah 46:4: ἐγώ εἰμι καὶ ἕως ἂν καταγηράσητε ἐγώ εἰμι

- "I-am, and until you grow old, I-am"
- Divine faithfulness declaration

Isaiah 51:12: ἐγώ εἰμι ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ παρακαλῶν σε

- "I-am, I-am the one comforting you"
- Doubled for emphasis, divine comfort declaration

This extensive background from the Septuagint, especially in Isaiah, forms the theological foundation for understanding Jesus' use of ἐγώ εἰμι in the New Testament.

## **Biblical Patterns**

### **The Divine Name Pattern**

The ἐγώ εἰμι declarations connect to the Hebrew divine name (YHWH) through several patterns:

1. **Exodus Connection**

   - Exodus 3:14 - God declares "I AM WHO I AM" (אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה)
   - Translated in LXX as ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν ("I-am the being one")
   - Jesus' use of ἐγώ εἰμι echoes this divine self-revelation

2. **Absolute Usage**

   - Used without predicate (John 8:58, 18:5-6)
   - Provokes strong reactions (worship or attempted stoning)
   - Carries divine implications recognized by hearers

3. **Protection Formula**
   - "I-am; do not be afraid" (Mark 6:50, John 6:20)
   - Parallels divine appearances in Old Testament
   - Combines presence declaration with fear removal

### **The Seven "I Am" Statements in John**

John's Gospel contains seven metaphorical "I am" statements that form a structured pattern:

1. "I-am the bread of life" (6:35, 41, 48, 51)
2. "I-am the light of the world" (8:12, 9:5)
3. "I-am the door" (10:7, 9)
4. "I-am the good shepherd" (10:11, 14)
5. "I-am the resurrection and the life" (11:25)
6. "I-am the way, the truth, and the life" (14:6)
7. "I-am the true vine" (15:1, 5)

These statements create a comprehensive theology of Christ's role and relationship to believers through everyday images that carry profound theological significance:

- Sustenance (bread)
- Guidance (light)
- Access (door)
- Protection (shepherd)
- Victory (resurrection)
- Direction (way)
- Fruitfulness (vine)

### **The "I Am Not" Contrast Pattern**

John the Baptist creates a deliberate contrast with Jesus through "I am not" statements:

- "I am not the Christ" (John 1:20)
- "I am not [Elijah]" (John 1:21)
- "I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal" (John 1:27)
- "He must increase, but I must decrease" (John 3:30)

This negative formulation emphasizes the unique divine identity expressed in Jesus' positive "I-am" declarations.

### **The Recognition Pattern**

Several passages show a pattern where an "I-am" declaration leads to recognition of Jesus' identity:

1. Samaritan Woman (John 4:26)

   - "I who speak to you am he [I-am]"
   - Recognition and testimony follow

2. Walking on Water (John 6:20, Mark 6:50)

   - "I-am; do not be afraid"
   - Disciples worship and confess

3. Blind Man Healing (John 9)

   - Man declares "I-am" (v.9)
   - Later recognizes Jesus and worships

4. Arrest Scene (John 18:5-6)
   - "I-am" causes soldiers to fall back
   - Recognition of power without acceptance

This pattern shows how the "I-am" declaration functions as a moment of revelation that demands response.

## **Cultural Context**

### **Greek Philosophical Background**

While the primary background is Hebrew, Greek philosophical concepts of being are relevant:

- **Parmenides** argued that true reality consists in unchanging "being"
- **Plato** distinguished between permanent being and changing becoming
- **Aristotle** explored the various senses of "being" and "is"

For Greek readers, Jesus' "I-am" statements would connect both to Hebrew divine claims and Greek philosophical discourse about the nature of true being and reality.

### **Roman Imperial Context**

The Roman imperial cult promoted the divine status of the emperor:

- Imperial inscriptions declaring divine identity
- Emperor as mediator between gods and men
- Claims of pre-existence and eternal significance

Jesus' "I-am" declarations would have been understood as counter-imperial claims in this context.

### **Reading Note for English Readers**

Modern readers might think of:

- Simple self-identification ("It's me")
- Statement of role or occupation ("I am a teacher")
- Existential statement ("I think, therefore I am")

Instead, picture:

- A king declaring his presence in a throne room
- The author of a play stepping into their own creation
- The source of existence naming itself
- The eternal present moment personified

The phrase carries both utter simplicity and unfathomable depth—a two-word cosmos that encompasses all divine self-revelation.

## **Theological Significance**

### **Present Continuous Being**

The present tense of εἰμί suggests continuous, timeless existence:

- Not "I was" (past)
- Not "I will be" (future)
- But "I-am" (eternal present)

This grammatical feature carries profound theological implications about Christ's eternal nature, existing outside normal temporal limitations.

### **Relation to Incarnation**

The "I-am" declarations create a theological bridge between:

- Eternal divine existence
- Historical human presence

The same voice that spoke from the burning bush now speaks through human lips in Galilee, creating a powerful connection between transcendence and immanence.

### **Identity and Mission**

The predicates in the seven "I am" statements reveal how Christ's being connects to his saving work:

1. Identity: "I-am" (who Jesus is in essence)
2. Mission: "the bread/light/door" etc. (how this identity functions for believers)

This demonstrates that in biblical thought, being and doing are inseparable—to be is to act, and to truly act flows from authentic being.

### **Trinitarian Implications**

While primarily focusing on Christ's divine identity, the "I-am" statements also have trinitarian dimensions:

- Distinct from yet continuous with the Father's "I AM" in Exodus
- Often connected to the Spirit's work in the same contexts
- Establishes both unity (same divine identity) and distinction (personal relationship)

### **Invitation to Participation**

The "I-am" statements often contain an implied invitation:

- "I-am the bread of life" → "come and eat"
- "I-am the light of the world" → "follow me"
- "I-am the resurrection" → "believe and live"

This transforms divine self-disclosure from abstract theology into relational opportunity—the eternal "I-am" invites finite beings into his infinite life.
