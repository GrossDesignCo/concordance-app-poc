## Prefix Conventions

When transliterating prefixed Hebrew elements, use hyphens to show the connection:

| Prefix           | Hebrew | Transliteration | Example                       |
| ---------------- | ------ | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| "In/at/by"       | בְּ    | be-             | be-reshit ("in-beginning")    |
| "To/for"         | לְ     | le-             | le-david ("for-David")        |
| "Like/as"        | כְּ    | ke-             | ke-chol ("like-sand")         |
| "And"            | וְ     | ve- or u-       | ve-ha'aretz ("and-the-earth") |
| "From"           | מִ     | mi- or me-      | mi-mitsrayim ("from-Egypt")   |
| Definite article | הַ     | ha-             | ha-shamayim ("the-heavens")   |
| Interrogative    | הֲ     | ha-             | ha-shomer ("the-keeper?")     |

## Special Cases

1. **Word-Initial Sheva**: Typically not transliterated
2. **Sequential Sheva**: Only the first is transliterated as "e"
3. **Word-Final He with Mappiq**: Transliterated as "h" (pronounced)
4. **Final Letters**: Transliterated the same as their non-final forms
5. **Dagesh Forte (Doubling)**: Shown by doubling the consonant

## Capitalization Conventions for the Concordance Project

For transliterated Hebrew terms in entry titles:

1. Prefixes and suffixes are lowercase
2. Root words are capitalized
3. For compound forms, each root is capitalized
4. The conjunction "ve/va" remains lowercase

Examples:

- beReshit (בְּרֵאשִׁית) - prefix "be-" lowercase, root "Reshit" capitalized
- Tohu vaVohu (תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ) - first word capitalized, conjunction "va" lowercase, second root "Vohu" capitalized
- miMitsrayim (מִמִּצְרַיִם) - prefix "mi-" lowercase, root "Mitsrayim" capitalized

## Practical Example: Distinguishing Similar Roots

Consider the phrase "רָאָה רָעָה" from Proverbs 22:3:

1. **רָאָה** - Transliterate as "ra'ah" (with apostrophe for aleph)
2. **רָעָה** - Transliterate as "raʻah" (with reverse apostrophe for ayin)

This visually distinguishes:

- The root ר-א-ה (r-'-h, "see") with aleph
- From the root ר-ע-ה (r-ʻ-h, "bad") with ayin

## Digital Alternatives

For environments where special characters are difficult to render:

| Character  | ASCII Alternative | Example |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| ʻ (ayin)   | ` (backtick)      | ra`ah   |
| ' (aleph)  | ' (apostrophe)    | ra'ah   |
| ā (long a) | aa                | raah    |
| ē (long e) | ee                | resheet |
| ō (long o) | oo                | toohu   |

This system prioritizes visual clarity for readers while maintaining scholarly integrity in the representation of Hebrew sounds and structure.
