And-the-land was waste and-void; 
and-darkness over-face-of deep.
And-Wind, Gods, was-stirring over-face-of the-waters.

And-said, Gods, "Let-be light."
And-was light.

And-saw Gods ↳ the-light that good. 
And-separated Gods between the-light, and-between the-darkness.

And-called Gods to-light, "Day,"
and-to-darkness, called, "Night." 
And-was, evening, 
And-was, morning, 
Day one.

And-said Gods "Let-be hammered_out_work in-midst-of the-waters,
and-let-be separating between waters to-waters."

And-made Gods ↳ the-hammered_out_work, 
And-separated, between the-waters which from-under to_the-hammered_out_work, and-between the-waters which from-over to_the-hammered_out_work. 
And-it-was so.

And-called, Gods, to_the-hammered_out_work, "Skies."

And-said, Gods, "Let-gather, the-waters, from-under the-skies, to→ place, one.
And-let-appear, the-dry_ground."
And-it-was so.
