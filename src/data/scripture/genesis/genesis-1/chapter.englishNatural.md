In heading, God created the skies and the land.

And the land was waste and void; 
and darkness over the face of the deep.
And the Wind of God was stirring over the face of the waters.

And God said, "Let light be."
And light was.

And God saw the light; good. 
And God separated between the light, and between the darkness.

And God called light "Day,"
and called darkness "Night."

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
One day.

And God said, "Let hammering-out be in the midst of the waters,
and let it be separating between waters and waters."

And God made the hammering-out, 
and separated between the waters which were under the hammering-out, and between the waters which were over the hammering-out. 
And it was so.

And God called the hammering-out, "Skies."

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
A second day.

And God said, "Let the waters gather from under the skies to one place. And let the dry-ground appear."
And it was so.

And God called the dry-ground "Land,"
and called the gathering of the waters "Seas."
And God saw that-it-was good.

And God said, "Let the land sprout grass, herb seeding seed, fruit tree making fruit after its kind, which has its seed in it, over the land." 
And it was so.

And the land brought forth grass, herb seeding seed after its kind, and tree making fruit which has its seed in it after its kind. 
And God saw that-it-was good.

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
A third day.

And God said, "Let there be lights in the hammering-out, the skies, to separate between the day, and between the night, 
And they will be for signs, and for appointed-times, and for days, and years.
And they will be for lights in the hammering-out, the skies, to shine-light over the land.

And God made two, the light-sources, the greats, 
the light-source the great, for the ruling of the day, 
And the light-source the small, for the ruling of the night, 
And the stars.

And God put them in the hammering-out, the skies, to shine-light over the land.
And to rule in the day, and in the night, 
and to separate between the light, and between the darkness, 
And God saw that-it-was good.

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
A fourth day.

And God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarm living throat, 
And let flyer fly over the land, over the face of the hammering-out, the skies.

And God created the monsters, the greats, 
And all throat the living the crawling which swarmed the waters, to their kind, And all flyer winged to its kind, 
And God saw that-it-was good.

And God blessed them saying, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and the flying things let multiply in the land.

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
A fifth day.
