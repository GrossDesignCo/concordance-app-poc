In heading, God created the skies and the land.

And the land was waste and void; 
and darkness over the face of the deep.
And the Wind of God was stirring over the face of the waters.

And God said, "Let light be."
And light was.

And God saw the light; good. 
And God separated between the light, and between the darkness.

And God called light "Day,"
and called darkness "Night."

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
One day.

And God said, "Let hammered-out-work be in the midst of the waters,
and let it be separating between waters and waters."

And God made the hammered-out-work, 
and separated between the waters which were under the hammered-out-work, and between the waters which were over the hammered-out-work. 
And it was so.

And God called the hammered-out-work, "Skies."

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
A second day.

And God said, "Let the waters gather from under the skies to one place. And let the dry-ground appear."
And it was so.

And God called the dry-ground "Land,"
and called the gathering of the waters "Seas."
And God saw that-it-was good.

And God said, "Let the land sprout grass, herb seeding seed, fruit tree making fruit after its kind, which has its seed in it, over the land." 
And it was so.

And the land brought forth grass, herb seeding seed after its kind, and tree making fruit which has its seed in it after its kind. 
And God saw that-it-was good.

And evening was, 
And morning was, 
A third day.

And God said, "Let there be lights in the hammered-out-work, the skies, to separate between the day, and between the night, 
And they will be for signs, and for appointed times, and for days, and years.
And they will be for lights in the hammered-out-work, the skies, to shine over the land.

And God made two, the light-bearers, the greats, 
the light-bearer the great, for the ruling of the day, 
And the light-bearer the small, for the ruling of the night, 
And the stars.

And God put them in the hammered-out-work, the skies, to shine-light over the land.
