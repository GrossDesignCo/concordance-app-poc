In heading, God created the skies and the land.

And the land was waste and void; 
and darkness over the face of the deep.
And the Wind of God was stirring over the face of the waters.

And God said, "Let light be."
And light was.

And God saw the light; good. 
And God separated between the light, and between the darkness.

And God called light "Day,"
and called darkness "Night." 
And evening was, 
And morning was, 
Day one.

And God said, "Let hammered-out-work be in the midst of the waters,
and let it be separating between waters and waters."

And God made the hammered-out-work, 
and separated between the waters which were under the hammered-out-work, and between the waters which were over the hammered-out-work. 
And it was so.

And God called the hammered-out-work, "Skies."

And God said, "Let the waters gather from under the skies to one place. And let the dry-ground appear."
And it was so.

And God called the dry-ground "Land,"
and called the gathering of the waters "Seas."
And God saw that-it-was good.
