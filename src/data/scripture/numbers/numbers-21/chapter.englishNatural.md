And I-AM sent the snakes, the burning-ones, among the people, and they struck the people; and many people of Struggles-With-God died.

And the people came to Moses and said, "We have sinned, that we have spoken against I-AM and against you; pray to I-AM, and may he turn-aside the snake from over us." And Moses prayed on behalf of the people.

And I-AM said to Moses, "Make for yourself a burning-one, and place it over a standard; and it shall come about, everyone who is struck, and sees it, will live."

And Moses made a bronze snake, and he placed it on the standard; and it came about, if the snake struck a man, and he looked to the bronze snake, he lived.
