And-sent, I_AM, among-the-people ↳ the-snakes, the-burning_ones, and-they-struck ↳ the-people, and-died, people, many, from-Struggles_With_God.

And-came the-people to Moses and-they-said, "we-have-sinned, that we-have-spoken against-I_AM and-against-you, pray to I_AM, and-may-he-turn_aside from-over-us ↳ the-snake." And-prayed Moses on-behalf-of the-people.

And-said I_AM to Moses, "Make for-yourself burning_one, and-place it over standard, and-it-will-be, all the-struck, and-sees it, and-lives."

And-made, Moses, snake, bronze, and-he-placed-it on the-standard, and-it-was, if struck the-snake ↳ man, and-he-looked to snake, the-bronze, and-lived.
