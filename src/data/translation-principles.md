# Translation Principles

The goal is to create as close to a 1:1 Hebrew:English mapping as possible, even when treating words/concepts in seemingly strange ways to a typical English reader. This mapping serves as both a useful tool for students of scripture and helps bring familiarity with the biblical mind/conceptualization to English speakers.

## AI Usage

1. Translations may be initially AI-generated, then later human-reviewed/edited
2. AIs should never edit translations or entries that have been human-approved without explicit permission

## Transliteration Principles

1. Use underscores for single Hebrew words translated as English phrases
   - "Hesed" = "steadfast_love"
   - "Eleazer" = "God_My_Help"
      - "God_My_Help will inherit my house"
   - "Israel" = "Struggles_With_God"

2. Compound words should use camelCase to indicate prefixes
   - "בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית" = "beReshit" = "in-heading"

## English Literal Translation Principles

1. Remove transliterations in favor of direct translations (for both traditionally transliterated words and names)
   - Greek "Angelos" = "Messenger"
   - Hebrew "Seraphim" = "Burning Ones"
      - Always use the translated meaning rather than the transliterated form
   - Noah = Rest
      - "God rested Man in the garden"
      - "And he called his name Rest, saying 'At last this one will give us rest'"

1. Remove filler words
   - Typical translation of Gen 1:3: "then God said 'Let there be light', and there was light"
   - Actual Hebrew: "vaiYomer elohim yehi owr wayHi owr"
   - Literal translation: "And-said, God, 'be, light,' and-was, light."

2. Preserve the direct root in the English
   - Use a 1:1 Hebrew-to-English mapping whenever possible
   - Hebrew "ruach" = "wind" (not "spirit" or "breath")
   - Allow context and usage to reshape the meaning of the English words over successive readings

3. Match word complexity where possible
   - "Ra'ah" = "bad" (not "disaster" or "evil")

4. Preserve word distinctions
   - When translating multiple related Hebrew words with different roots, always use different English words
   - Hebrew "Leviathan" = "Sea-Dragon", Hebrew "Tannin" = "Sea_Serpent", Hebrew "Nachash" = "Snake"
   - Maintain the distinction between similar concepts

5. Expressly render Hebrew את / et (direct object marker)
   - Keep Hebrew word order
   - Use ↳ to mark every direct object that Hebrew marks with את
   - Don't add interpretive markers
   - Let the "strangeness" of some constructions help readers recognize Hebrew's distinct way of expressing relationships   

## English Natural Translation Principles

1. Maintain readability while preserving meaning
   - Balance literal accuracy with natural English expression
   - Ensure the translation remains comprehensible while staying true to the original phrasing
