# **תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ (Tohu vaVohu, waste and-void)**

Picture a primordial wasteland: not just empty, but actively resisting order and habitation \- an anti-creation state that exists before or after God's organizing work. Like a desert that not only lacks life but seems to defy it, or ruins so complete they negate the very memory of what stood before.

## **Roots**

### **תֹ֙הוּ֙ (tohu)**

ת-ה-ו (t-h-w) \- Formlessness, confusion, unreality

### **וָבֹ֔הוּ (vohu)**

ב-ה-ו (b-h-w) \- Emptiness, void

The pair creates a compound concept stronger than either word alone, using alliteration and assonance to emphasize totality. The \-hu ending on both words creates a rhyming reinforcement suggesting completeness.

Closest English mapping: "waste and-void" \- preserving both the conjunction and the dual aspects of formlessness and emptiness while maintaining some of the phonetic impact of the original.

## **In-Context**

The phrase appears in three key passages, each describing either an initial state before God's creative work or the result of His un-creating judgment:

Genesis 1:2 "And the earth was **waste and-void**, and darkness was over the face of the deep..."

- Initial state before God's organizing work
- Context of potential, awaiting divine action
- Paired with darkness and deep waters

Jeremiah 4:23 "I looked at the earth, and behold, it was **waste and-void**; and to the heavens, and they had no light."

- Vision of judgment undoing creation
- Deliberate echo of Genesis 1:2
- Represents complete devastation

Isaiah 34:11 "...He shall stretch over it the line of **waste** and the stones of **void**."

- Prophecy of judgment against Edom
- Measuring tools normally used for building are used for un-building
- Words separated but clearly referencing the Genesis pair

## **Related Concepts**

שָׁמֵם (shamem) \- Desolation

- Used for inhabited places made uninhabitable
- Implies devastation of what once was
- "The land is made **desolate**" (Jeremiah 4:27)

חָרֵב (charev) \- Ruin/Waste

- Focuses on physical destruction
- Often used for cities and buildings
- "The cities will be **ruined**" (Ezekiel 6:6)

רִיק (riq) \- Emptiness

- More neutral emptiness
- Can be filled or useful
- "Empty vessels" (2 Kings 4:3)

Unlike these words, תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ describes a more fundamental disorder \- not just the absence of order but its opposite.

## **Literary and Thematic Patterns**

### **Anti-Creation Pattern**

The phrase functions as the opposite of God's creative activity:

| Creation | Tohu vaVohu  |
| :------- | :----------- |
| Order    | Chaos        |
| Form     | Formlessness |
| Fullness | Emptiness    |
| Light    | Darkness     |
| Life     | Lifelessness |

This pattern appears in both creative and un-creative contexts:

1. Before creation (Genesis 1:2)
2. In judgment undoing creation (Jeremiah 4:23)
3. In prophecies of devastating judgment (Isaiah 34:11)

### **Measuring Line Pattern**

Isaiah's usage connects to a broader pattern of measuring lines in Scripture:

- Usually for building (Zechariah 1:16)
- Sometimes for judgment (2 Kings 21:13)
- In Isaiah 34:11, measuring for tohu shows complete reversal of purpose

### **Genesis 1 Echo Pattern**

Later uses deliberately echo Genesis 1:2:

- Same vocabulary
- Similar word order
- Associated with darkness
- Connected to waters

These parallels create a theological link between pre-creation and judgment.

## **Translation Notes**

Standard English translations vary:

- "without form and void" (KJV, ESV)
- "formless and empty" (NIV)
- "waste and void" (ASV)
- "chaos" (NETS \- Septuagint)
- "welter and waste" (Alter)

None fully capture the alliterative and rhyming character of the Hebrew phrase.

## **Common Misunderstandings**

- Often misunderstood as simple emptiness or chaos
- Not "chaos" in the Greek sense of primordial material
- Not merely absence of form but resistance to it
- Not just empty space but active negation
- The repetition isn't just poetic but emphasizes totality

## **Greek/Septuagint Usage**

In the Septuagint (LXX), תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ is translated as:

Genesis 1:2: ἀόρατος καὶ ἀκατασκεύαστος

- "Invisible and unformed/unprepared"
- Loses the Hebrew alliteration and rhyme
- Shifts meaning toward Greek philosophical concepts

Isaiah 34:11: εἰς τὸ κενὸν

- "Into the void"
- Simplifies to single concept
- Loses the doubled emphasis

Jeremiah 4:23: οὐθέν

- "Nothing"
- Even more simplified
- Loses the specific connotations

This variation shows the difficulty of capturing the phrase's full meaning in translation.

## **Archaeological Context**

Understanding how תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ functions within Genesis requires awareness of how other ancient Near Eastern cultures described pre-creation states. This context highlights the distinct theological message of the biblical account.

### **Egyptian Concepts**

- Nun: The primordial waters
  - Personified as a god
  - Both destructive and generative
  - Source of all other gods
  - Continues to exist as a threat
- Isfet: Chaos/disorder
  - Opposite of Ma'at (order)
  - Active force requiring constant opposition
  - Never fully defeated

### **Mesopotamian Traditions**

- Tiamat: The chaotic sea
  - Mother goddess figure
  - Must be violently defeated for creation
  - Her body becomes creation
  - Chaos as a divine competitor
- Apsu: The freshwater abyss
  - Male counterpart to Tiamat
  - Source of wisdom and power
  - Creation emerges from divine conflict

### **Canaanite Mythology**

- Yamm: The turbulent sea
  - Rival to Baal
  - Represents disorder
  - Annual cycle of conflict
- Mot: Death/sterility
  - Opposition to fertility
  - Seasonal battle with Baal
  - Chaos linked to agricultural cycles

### **Biblical Distinctives**

Unlike these cultural parallels, תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ has several unique characteristics:

1. Theological Status

   - Not personified or deified
   - No independent power
   - Completely subject to God
   - Neither good nor evil, simply preliminary

2. Narrative Function

   - Starting point, not antagonist
   - No battle required
   - Ordered by divine speech alone
   - Can be restored as judgment

3. Cosmological Implications

   - No competing divine powers
   - No primordial conflict
   - Creation ex nihilo possible
   - Order comes through word, not violence

4. Literary Purpose
   - Describes state, not character
   - Focus on God's ordering work
   - Emphasizes sovereignty
   - Links creation and judgment

This context helps explain why Genesis' approach was so radical in its ancient setting. While other cultures saw primordial chaos as a divine force requiring combat, Genesis presents תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ as simply the "before" picture awaiting God's creative word.

## **Reading Note for English Readers**

Modern readers might think of:

- Empty space
- Random chaos
- Primitive disorder
- Raw materials

Instead, picture:

- A building's blueprint with anti-instructions
- A photograph's negative
- A place actively resisting order
- The opposite of creation itself

The phrase doesn't just describe absence but the very antithesis of created order.
