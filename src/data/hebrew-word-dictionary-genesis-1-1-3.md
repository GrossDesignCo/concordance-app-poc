## ב (Bet) Roots

### ב-ר-א (b-r-ʾ)

- **Primary meaning**: To create, shape, form (from nothing)
- **English mapping**: "create"
- **Notes**: Used exclusively with God as subject in Qal form. Implies creation without pre-existing materials. Distinguished from other creation verbs like י-צ-ר (form) and ע-ש-ה (make).
- **Example**: Genesis 1:1 - "In-heading **created** Gods heavens and-land"
- **Avoid**: "make", "form" (these translate other Hebrew roots)

## ר (Resh) Roots

### ר-א-שׁ (r-ʾ-š)

- **Primary meaning**: Head, top, beginning, chief
- **English mapping**: "head" (literal), "heading" (abstract)
- **Notes**: Root for רֵאשִׁית (reshit, "beginning/firstfruits"). Carries sense of both temporal priority and governing authority.
- **Example**: Genesis 1:1 - "In-**heading** created Gods heavens and-land"
- **Avoid**: "beginning" (loses connection to physical "head"), "first" (too limited)

### ר-ח-פ (r-ḥ-p)

- **Primary meaning**: To hover, flutter, move gently
- **English mapping**: "stir"
- **Notes**: Used for protective, nurturing movement. Only appears 3 times in Hebrew Bible (Genesis 1:2, Deuteronomy 32:11, Jeremiah 23:9).
- **Example**: Genesis 1:2 - "And-Wind-of Gods **stirring** on-face-of the-waters"
- **Avoid**: "hover" (too static), "flutter" (too random), "brood" (too interpretive)

### ר-ו-ח (r-w-ḥ)

- **Primary meaning**: Wind, breath, spirit
- **English mapping**: "wind"
- **Notes**: Spans physical wind, life-breath, and divine spirit. Maintaining consistent translation helps readers see these connections.
- **Example**: Genesis 1:2 - "And-**Wind**-of Gods stirring on-face-of the-waters"
- **Avoid**: "spirit" (for divine contexts), "breath" (for life contexts), as these mask connections in the Hebrew

## א (Aleph) Roots

### א-ו-ר (ʾ-w-r)

- **Primary meaning**: Light, illumination
- **English mapping**: "light"
- **Notes**: Used for both the phenomenon of light and light sources. Connected to concepts of revelation and life.

### א-מ-ר (ʾ-m-r)

- **Avoid**: "spoke", "declared", "stated" (use "say" consistently)

### א-ל-ה (ʾ-l-h)

- **Primary meaning**: God, divine being, mighty one
- **English mapping**: "God" (singular), "Gods" (plural for אֱלֹהִים)

- **Avoid**: "deity", "divine being" (less direct)

### א-ר-ץ (ʾ-r-ṣ)
