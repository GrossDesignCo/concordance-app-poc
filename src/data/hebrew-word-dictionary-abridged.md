## God Names

### י-ה-ו-ה (y-h-w-h)

- **Primary meaning**: The personal name of God in the Hebrew Bible
- **English mapping**: "I_am"
- **Notes**: This four-letter name (tetragrammaton) is related to the Hebrew verb "to be" (היה/hayah). In Exodus 3:14, God identifies himself as "I AM WHO I AM" (אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה/ehyeh asher ehyeh). Using "I_am" helps readers see connections between divine statements like "I am the LORD" (literally "I am I_am") and expressions like "the Lord GOD" (literally "I_am God").
- **Example**: Exodus 3:15 - "And-said still Gods to-Moses thus you-shall-say to-sons-of Israel I_am God-of fathers-your"
- **Historical note**: Jewish tradition avoids pronouncing this name out of reverence, traditionally substituting "Adonai" (Lord) or "HaShem" (The Name). Our translation approach prioritizes revealing the textual connections while still respecting the significance of the divine name.
- **Avoid**: "LORD" (obscures the personal name), "Jehovah" (inaccurate hybrid form), "Yahweh" (speculative pronunciation)

### א-ל-ה (ʾ-l-h)

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistency is key**: Use the chosen English mappings consistently across all contexts unless absolutely necessary to differentiate.

2. **Word order**: Follow Hebrew word order as closely as possible, particularly for verbs, subjects, and objects.

3. **Simplicity over complexity**: Choose simpler, shorter English words over complex ones when mapping.

4. **Show, don't tell**: Allow Hebrew patterns to emerge through consistent translation rather than explaining them in the translation.

5. **Gender and number**: Preserve grammatical gender and number where English allows.

6. **Preserve strangeness**: Allow unusual constructions to remain unusual rather than smoothing them to sound more natural in English.

7. **Compound words**: Use dashes to connect English words that translate a single Hebrew word.

8. **Hebrew repetition**: Maintain repetition patterns found in Hebrew rather than using synonyms for stylistic variation.

9. **Literal equivalence**: Aim for word-for-word correspondence rather than dynamic equivalence wherever possible.

10. **Theological neutrality**: Avoid importing theological interpretations into translation choices by using concrete, physical terms.

## Particularly Challenging Hebrew Words for Translation

Several Hebrew roots present particular challenges for translation, even with the possibility of multi-word mappings:

1. ח-ס-ד (ḥ-s-d) - "steadfast_love"

Challenge: This term encompasses covenant loyalty, mercy, love, and faithfulness in a way that's difficult to fully capture in English.
Options considered: "loyalty", "kindness", "mercy", "faithfulness", "steadfast_love"
Solution: "steadfast_love" best captures the covenant, loyalty, and compassion aspects.

2. פ-נ-ה (p-n-h) - "face"

Challenge: Used for face, presence, before, in front of, and turning.
Options considered: "face", "turn", "front", "presence"
Solution: "face" works best as a noun but misses the verbal sense of turning, which may need to be distinguished in some contexts.

3. נ-ש-א (n-ś-ʾ) - "lift"

Challenge: Means to lift physically, but also forgive (lift sin), carry (responsibility), take (a wife), raise (status).
Options considered: "lift", "carry", "bear", "raise"
Solution: "lift" best captures the physical basis that unites the various uses.

4. ת-ק-ו-ה (t-q-w-h) - "hope_cord"

Challenge: Literally means "cord" or "line" but metaphorically means "hope" or "expectation".
Options considered: "cord", "hope", "expectation", "hope_cord"
Solution: "hope_cord" preserves both concrete and abstract meanings.

5. צ-ד-ק (ṣ-d-q) - "right"

Challenge: Encompasses righteousness, justice, rightness, vindication.
Options considered: "right", "just", "righteous", "right_standing"
Solution: "right" works as a foundation but "right_standing" may be needed in juridical contexts.

6. י-ש-ב (y-š-b) vs. ש-כ-נ (š-k-n) - "sit" vs. "tent"

Challenge: Both mean "dwell" but with different nuances (permanent vs. temporary).
Solution: Using "sit" for י-ש-ב and "tent" (as a verb) for ש-כ-נ maintains distinction but sounds awkward in some contexts.

7. ש-ו-ב (š-w-b) - "return"

Challenge: Means physical return but also repentance, restoration, and reversal.
Options considered: "return", "repent", "restore", "turn_back"
Solution: "return" works in most contexts but "turn_back" might be clearer in certain passages.

8. ר-ו-ח (r-w-ḥ) - "wind"

Challenge: Spans physical wind, breath, and spirit in ways no English word does.
Options considered: "wind", "breath", "spirit", "life_force"
Solution: "wind" works as a foundation but may need contextual notes in spiritual contexts.

This dictionary serves as a foundational reference for consistent translation following the hyper-literalification principles. Its purpose is to:

- Provide consistent mappings for common Hebrew roots
- Ensure related concepts show their relationships through translation
- Maintain the concrete, physical basis of Hebrew expressions
- Help readers see patterns across Scripture that standard translations often obscure
