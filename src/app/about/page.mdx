# The Roots Translation (Preface)

(Hopefully) An excellent and genuine tool.

In a nutshell, it's simply standardizing the translation of any given word:

> "the serpent was more [(עָרוּם/arum) ~~**crafty**~~ **shrewd**] than any other..."

> "The [(עָרוּם/arum) ~~**prudent**~~ **shrewd**] sees danger and..."

## Background

Language is beautiful and amazing. God gives us the ability to communicate with one another by combining sounds into structures given meaning.

In the very beginning, God speaks, or "calls out" to creation. He names things; and then delegates that power, authority, and ability to Adam, who names all the creatures God presents to him.

Later, at the (first) fall of the Tower of Babylon, The Lord confuses humanity's languages. He split apart our most basic tool for connection to one another in one of his great acts of judgement, a ruling which stands to this day.

For individuals though, language is simply learned by pattern recognition. It's so foundational that nearly every child does this intuitively without even understanding the patterns they themselves are recognizing. Day by day, year by year, through repeated usage and context, trial and error, we learn what words mean. Each person develops their own slightly different language, which is an amalgum of all they've experienced.

This translation attempts to turn this to our advantage. It contains what we'll call a dialect, that isn't exactly proper english, but that renders the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek as directly and plainly as possible, sometimes making arbitrary choices for the sake of consistency.

By plainly rendering the original languages as consistently as possible, the hope is that the gap between the reader and the original languages will be partially bridged, and that readers over time will develop their own new model of the biblical worldview.

This new model uses English base words, but maps those base words more directly onto the original words and their usage.

## Translation Goals

This translation will (hopefully) appeal to the daily, meditative reader.

In order to get value from this project one must:

1. Come to the word for the word's own sake.
2. Appreciate the beauty and depth of the language.
3. Be willing to spend the time working through ambiguities and difficult concepts.

The translation itself will seek to handle a narrow set of specific goals in support of this reader's growth in wisdom.

### Core Principles

1. Consistently translate Hebrew & Greek root words using a 1:1 English mapping, allowing **usage and context** to determine their definition.
1. Create a comprehensive lexicon of biblical words and phrases showing their meaning **from usage**, so that scripture readers can form their own semantic range from the repeated contextual usage, rather than from secondary commentary.
1. Translate biblical names using their meanings to clearly see their intended wordplays.

### Capture Semantic Range

Many words, especially in Hebrew, cover a much broader semantic range than the average word in English, and even where there is crossover it's rarely a perfect overlap.

For example, the Hebrew word "**arum**" is frequently translated as either "crafty" or "prudent" depending on who it's being used to describe.

> "And the serpent was more [(עָרוּם/arum) ~~**crafty**~~ **shrewd**] than any other beast of the field..." - Genesis 3:1

> "[(עָרוּם/arum) ~~**The prudent**~~ **Shrewd**] sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it." - Proverbs 22:3

These English translations are solid renderings in the context of each verse, but lose some of the depth in the original hebrew concept of "**arum**".

Jesus later sums up this pattern when he says "Be **shrewd** (φρόνιμοι/phronimoi) as serpents and innocent as doves.

The reality of good shrewdness is that we are to be exceptionally perceptive, tactful, wise, while maintaining our childlike, simple honesty. Holding these two qualities in the same person creates a true and rich depth of character utterly absent from the people of the world.

If we consistently translate this word, even if the choice of corresponding word in English is a little strange, the reader will over time re-map their working mental image of that concept to the biblical usage of the word.

Over time this deepens not only their understanding of scripture, but hopefully gives them a more accurately mapped worldview to reality because of the time spent chewing on this deeper, but often nuanced language.

### Capture Verb-Noun Relationships

In English many nouns have connections to the verb that produced them, but in hebrew especially these relationships have a much more direct meaning.

For example, the Hebrew word "**raqia**", means a thing made by hammering-out/stretch/spread thin; typically this term is used of metalwork or jewelery, and is directly connected to the verb "**raqa**", which means to hammer-out/stretch/spread thin.

> "And God said, "Let [(רָקִיעַ/raqia) ~~**an expanse**~~ **hammered-out-work**] be in the midst of the waters,
> and let it be separating between waters and waters." - Genesis 1:6

> "And they [(וַיְרַקְּע֞וּ/vayRaqqe'u) **hammered-out**] the gold plates and cut them into threads to work into the blue and purple..." - Exodus 39:3

These shared roots directly connect the creation of the heavens to the construction of the tabernacle. These clusters of vocabulary build associations between specific passages of scripture, forming threads for us to follow in our reading.

### Work-in-Progress

1. Preserve as much as possible the original Hebrew and Greek wordplays/phrasing to best capture connections between concepts, again **from usage** rather than from commentary.
1. Fully translate traditionally transliterated terms to make the meaning/wording as clear a spossible.
1. Use early Greek translations of the Hebrew to inform our mappings when using words that cross language barriers, such as Hebrew "malach" and Greek "angelos", which both mean "messenger", and are frequently used of prophets, pastors, and the spiritual beings we normally call angels.
1. Especially focus on nouns, verbs, and adjectives, when sacrifices for readability must be made they should be made in the connecter words, like "as", "to", "from".
1. Make extensive use of English grammar to help slow and guide the reader where necessary.

## Hebrew → Transliteraiton → English-Literal → English-Natural Versions

As a part of building an understanding of the Hebrew language, it seemed good to create something of an intermediate translation, a literal mapping that isn't exactly English, but that uses English words/elements to better show the Hebrew's word construction.

Thus, by showing the exact progression of translation, any person reading should be able to see and validate the quality of the translation, seeing over time the patterns in the original language and providing feedback.

Example: Genesis 1:1

Starting with the Hebrew:

> בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית בָּרָ֣א אֱלֹהִ֑ים אֵ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְאֵ֥ת הָאָֽרֶץ

We render the following transliteration:

> "beReshit bara Elohim et haShamayim veEt haAretz"

Since Hebrew makes extensive use of prefixes where English has distinct words, we use camelCase to help distinguish the word structure.

From there we create a hyper-literal mapping of the Hebrew to English-ish:

> "In-heading, created Gods ↳ the-heavens and-↳ the-land"

This includes features of Hebrew grammar like the direct-object-marker, using a return arrow to represent the Hebrew more literally than any normal English translation. It also connects prefixes in Hebrew to the corresponding words in English via dashes (-), and uses underscores (\_) to indicate where multiple English words have been put together to help capture a single Hebrew word (eg. hesed → "steadfast_love")

This then informs the "final" translation, now using English word order and grammar:

> "In heading, God created the heavens and the land"

Showing and maintaining a clear set of intermediate translations like this helps to proof the translation against inconsistencies.
