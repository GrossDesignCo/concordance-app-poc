# The Roots Translation (Preface)

(Hopefully) An excellent and genuine tool.

In a nutshell, it's simply standardizing the translation of any given word:

> "the serpent was more [(עָרוּם/arum) ~~**crafty**~~ **shrewd**] than any other..."

> "The [(עָרוּם/arum) ~~**prudent**~~ **shrewd**] sees danger and..."

## Background

Language is beautiful and amazing. God gives us the ability to communicate with one another by combining sounds into structures given meaning.

In the very beginning, God speaks, or "calls out" to creation. He names things; and then delegates that power, authority, and ability to Adam, who names all the creatures God presents to him.

Later, at the (first) fall of the Tower of Babylon, The Lord confuses humanity's languages. He split apart our most basic tool for connection to one another in one of his great acts of judgement, a ruling which stands to this day.

For individuals though, language is simply learned by pattern recognition. It's so foundational that nearly every child does this intuitively without even understanding the patterns they themselves are recognizing. Day by day, year by year, through repeated usage and context, trial and error, we learn what words mean. Each person develops their own slightly different language, which is an amalgum of all they've experienced.

This translation attempts to turn this to our advantage. It contains what we'll call a dialect, that isn't exactly proper english, but that renders the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek as directly and plainly as possible, sometimes making arbitrary choices for the sake of consistency.

By plainly rendering the original languages as consistently as possible, the hope is that the gap between the reader and the original languages will be partially bridged, and that readers over time will develop their own new model of the biblical worldview.

This new model uses English base words, but maps those base words more directly onto the original words and their usage.

## Translation Goals

This translation will (hopefully) appeal to the daily, meditative reader.

In order to get value from this project one must:

1. Come to the word for the word's own sake.
2. Appreciate the beauty and depth of the language.
3. Be willing to spend the time working through ambiguities and difficult concepts.

The translation itself will seek to handle a narrow set of specific goals in support of this reader's growth in wisdom.

### Core Principles

1. **Consistently translate Hebrew & Greek root words** using a 1:1 English mapping, allowing **usage and context** to determine their definition.
1. **Create a comprehensive lexicon** of biblical words and phrases showing their meaning **from usage**, so that scripture readers can form their own semantic range from the repeated contextual usage, rather than from secondary commentary.
1. **Translate biblical names** using their meanings to clearly see their intended wordplays.

### Capture Scripture's Natural Linkages

The vocabulary of scripture naturally creates it's own form of cross-references. In Jonah, we find heaps of similar vocabulary words to the accounts in Genesis and other earlier writings, linking the sections of scripture together.

This is fairly intuitive to readers of the original languages, and hopefully by consistently rendering the individual vocabulary in English these natural linkages will become apparent to English readers.

### Capture Semantic Range

Many words, especially in Hebrew, cover a much broader semantic range than the average word in English, and even where there is crossover it's rarely a perfect overlap.

For example, the Hebrew word "**arum**" is frequently translated as either "crafty" or "prudent" depending on who it's being used to describe.

> "And the serpent was more [(עָרוּם/arum) ~~**crafty**~~ **shrewd**] than any other beast of the field..." - Genesis 3:1

> "[(עָרוּם/arum) ~~**The prudent**~~ **Shrewd**] sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it." - Proverbs 22:3

These English translations are solid renderings in the context of each verse, but lose some of the depth in the original hebrew concept of "**arum**".

Jesus later sums up this pattern when he says "Be **shrewd** (φρόνιμοι/phronimoi) as serpents and innocent as doves.

The reality of good shrewdness is that we are to be exceptionally perceptive, tactful, wise, while maintaining our childlike, simple honesty. Holding these two qualities in the same person creates a true and rich depth of character utterly absent from the people of the world.

If we consistently translate this word, even if the choice of corresponding word in English is a little strange, the reader will over time re-map their working mental image of that concept to the biblical usage of the word.

Over time this deepens not only their understanding of scripture, but hopefully gives them a more accurately mapped worldview to reality because of the time spent chewing on this deeper, but often nuanced language.

### Capture Actor-Action-Object Relationships

In English many nouns have connections to the verb that produced them, but in hebrew especially these relationships have a much more direct meaning.

For example, in English an "invention" is a thing made by "inventing", which is done by a person called an "inventor". This relationship appears in some English contexts, but frequently parts of the chain are missing, such as in the case of a "keeper", who "keeps", the "[thing that is kept]".

By comparison, the Hebrew word "**raqia**", means a thing made by hammering-out/stretch/spread thin; typically this term is used of metalwork or jewelery, and is directly connected to the verb "**raqa**", which means to hammer-out/stretch/spread thin.

> "And God said, "Let [(רָקִיעַ/raqia) ~~**an expanse**~~ **hammering-out**] be in the midst of the waters,
> and let it be separating between waters and waters." - Genesis 1:6

> "And they [(וַיְרַקְּע֞וּ/vayRaqqe'u) **hammered-out**] the gold plates and cut them into threads to work into the blue and purple..." - Exodus 39:3

These shared roots directly connect the creation of the heavens to the construction of the tabernacle. These clusters of vocabulary build associations between specific passages of scripture, forming threads for us to follow in our reading.

### Work-in-Progress Principles

1. **Preserve the original Hebrew and Greek wordplays** as much as possible to best capture connections between concepts, again **from usage** rather than from commentary. (eg. "nachash nashach" → "snake strike", preserving the similar sounding words)
1. **Fully translate traditionally transliterated terms** to make the meaning/wording as clear a spossible. (eg. "Apostellos" → "Sent_Ones")
1. Use early Greek translations of the Hebrew to inform our mappings when using words that cross language barriers, such as Hebrew "malach" and Greek "angelos", which both mean "messenger", and are frequently used of prophets, pastors, and the spiritual beings we normally call angels.
1. Especially focus on nouns, verbs, and adjectives, when sacrifices for readability must be made they should be made in the connecter words, like "as", "to", "from".
1. Make extensive use of English grammar to help slow and guide the reader where necessary. (eg. frequently converting "And X" into a line break)

## Translation Process

**Hebrew → Transliteration → English-Literal → English-Natural Versions**

As a part of building an understanding of the Hebrew language, it seemed good to create something of an intermediate translation, a literal mapping that isn't exactly English, but that uses English words/elements to better show the Hebrew's word construction.

Thus, by showing the exact progression of translation, any person reading should be able to see and validate the quality of the translation, seeing over time the patterns in the original language and providing feedback.

### Example: Genesis 1:1

Starting with the Hebrew:

> בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית בָּרָ֣א אֱלֹהִ֑ים אֵ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְאֵ֥ת הָאָֽרֶץ

We render the following transliteration:

> "beReshit bara Elohim et haShamayim veEt haAretz"

Since Hebrew makes extensive use of prefixes where English has distinct words, we use camelCase to help distinguish the word structure.

From there we create a hyper-literal mapping of the Hebrew to an English-ish word structure we can use for translation:

> "In-heading, created Gods ↳ the-skies and-↳ the-land"

This includes features of Hebrew grammar like the direct-object-marker, using a return arrow to represent the Hebrew more literally than any normal English translation. It also connects prefixes in Hebrew to the corresponding words in English via dashes (-), and uses underscores (\_) to indicate where multiple English words have been put together to help capture a single Hebrew word (eg. hesed → "steadfast_love")

This then informs the "final" translation, now using English word order and grammar:

> "In heading, God created the skies and the land"

Showing and maintaining a clear set of intermediate translations like this helps to proof the translation against inconsistencies.

## Notable Exceptions

### Bedolach/Bdellium in Genesis 2

This appears to be a word that has a genuinely unknown meaning, going all the way back to Babylonian/Akkadian commentaries noting the difficulty of translating it.

The Septuagint simply transliterates the Hebrew Bedolach into Bdellium. We preserve a basic hebrew transliteration, which adds to the mystique/exotic-ness of the descriptions of the four pre-flood nations.

Coincidentally there is also a kind of resin coming from India that is called Bdellium in the modern day, but it's unclear whether this matches up with the resource from Genesis 2. See Lexicon for further discussion.

## Manuscript Selection

In an attempt to bypass the majority of ancient manuscript debates, which usually amount to small presences or absences of a supporting phrase or passage. This translation generally uses the most widely passed down "received" text as it's basis, which supported the translations of the Vulgate and King James Version.

When a passage or phrase is missing in some manuscripts, this version will simply include it with no additional commentary. This project aims primarily to understand the text received in it's entirety.

## Difficult Words with Fuzzy/In-Progress Translations

Generally this translation side-steps difficult word choices by simply rendering _a_ word and then consistently using it to build a new semantic meaning from context, however there are some words or word-sets that prove difficult.

### El / Elohe / Elohim

God is handled in several ways in Hebrew, this translation attempts to distinguish clearly between them. In the literal-english it preserves the plural "Gods" everywhere, regardless of which Gods the text is talking about. It's often paired with masculine singular verbs, which is helpful in understanding, but may be especially confusing for newer English readers, hence the natural-english uses "God" singular always.

In some cases "El" is used, especially in the construction of names. Currently this translation keeps "God" singular, but is almost closer to "G—", though this doesn't quite feel satisfactory.

For example, Eleazer is translated "God-my-Help", even though "G—my-Help" would likely be more appropriate.

### YHWH / YahWeh / Yah

Similarly, the name of the Lord is frequently shortened/modified when combining it with other words.

Currently this translation uses "He—" (emdash) for "Yah", especially when used in names to indicate which "he" is being referenced.

YahWeh is a unique construction of the verb hayah / to be. Notably it's similar to the third person "he is" but distinct from it. This translation uses "He-Who-Is" in a similar naming convention to other names.

### Amen

Jesus's famous "Truly truly..." statements start with the Greek "Amen amen...".

It might be best to use "amen" since it's a common enough English word, but that is also a generally religious word with no common meaning in most people's minds.

### Adam / Adamah / Adom

Currently "Human" and "Soil" are separate, but a connection should be indicated here somehow.

On a literary level, "Adam" is more like "Earthling", but that sounds too space-age.

"Earthen-One" and "Earth" might cover this better.

Adom likewise means "Red", like the iron-rich soil/clay.

### Arum / Arom

Currently Shrewd and Naked are separate, but the words share the same root consonants, and have a thematic link, which should be indicated somehow.

Possibly more like Naked and "Naked-sight", where the Srewd sees right through what is covered. This may be a thematic link, but the wordplay is lost in English.
