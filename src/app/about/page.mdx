# About the Roots Translation

(Hopefully) An excellent and genuine tool.

In a nutshell, it's simply standardizing the translation of any given word:

> "the serpent was more [(עָרוּם/arum) ~~**crafty**~~ **shrewd**] than any other..."

> "The [(עָרוּם/arum) ~~**prudent**~~ **shrewd**] sees danger and..."

## Background

English translations generally fall into two camps, "word-for-word", and "thought-for-thought". These attempt to bridge the gap between the language of the ancient audience and the modern reader.

As any regular reader of scripture knows, The Word is deep, and you can spend your entire life reading it over and over and never hit the bottom, never have it fully in your grasp. There's always a new insight, always something you haven't seen before, a connection you haven't made.

The language scripture uses to describe the realities of the Lord's creation is designed for exactly this kind of lifelong exploration. It's concepts are deep, and often exceedingly difficult for mere mortals.

## Translation Goals

This translation will (hopefully) appeal to the daily, meditative reader. The person who spends regular, devoted time in their bible, who earnestly desires:

1. to come to the word for the word's own sake
2. to appreciate the beauty and depth of the language

Many words, especially in Hebrew, cover a much broader semantic range than the average word in English, and even where there is crossover it's rarely a perfect overlap.

Language is formed over time through context and usage, and my hope to allow the scripture to define its own terms in this way.

For example, the Hebrew word "**arum**" is frequently translated as either "crafty" or "prudent" depending on who it's being used to describe.

> "And the serpent was more **crafty** than any other beast of the field..." - Genesis 3:1 (ESV)

> "The **prudent** sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it." - Proverbs 22:3 (ESV)

These English translations are solid renderings in the context of each verse, but lose some of the depth in the original hebrew concept of "**arum**".

Jesus later sums up this pattern when he says "Be **shrewd** (φρόνιμοι/phronimoi) as serpents and innocent as doves.

The reality of good shrewdness is that we are to be exceptionally perceptive, tactful, wise, while maintaining our childlike, simple honesty. Holding these two qualities in the same person creates a true and rich depth of character utterly absent from the people of the world.

If we consistently translate this word, even if the choice of corresponding word in English is a little strange, the reader will over time re-map their working mental image of that concept to the biblical usage of the word.

Over time this deepens not only their understanding of scripture, but hopefully gives them more accurately mapped worldview to reality because of the time spent chewing on this deeper, but often nuanced and difficult language.

The goal is not to shy away from the most difficult biblical passages and language, but to render each passage as plainly and consistently as possible, removing as much of the distance between the reader and the author as possible.

### Core Principles

1. Consistently translate Hebrew & Greek root words using a 1:1 English mapping, allowing **usage and context** to determine their definition.
1. Create a comprehensive lexicon of biblical words and phrases showing their meaning **from usage**, so that scripture readers can form their own semantic range from the repeated contextual usage, rather than from secondary commentary.
1. Translate biblical names using their meanings to clearly see their intended wordplays.

### Work-in-Progress

1. Preserve as much as possible the original Hebrew and Greek wordplays/phrasing to best capture connections between concepts, again **from usage** rather than from commentary.
1. Fully translate traditionally transliterated terms to make the meaning/wording as clear a spossible.
1. Use early Greek translations of the Hebrew to inform our mappings when using words that cross language barriers, such as Hebrew "malach" and Greek "angelos", which both mean "messenger", and are frequently used of prophets, pastors, and spiritual beings.
1. Especially focus on nouns, verbs, and adjectives, when sacrifices for readability must be made they should be made in the connecter words, like "as", "to", "from".
1. Make extensive use of English grammar to help slow and guide the reader where necessary.

## English-Literal & English-Natural Versions

As a part of building an understanding of the Hebrew language, it seemed good to create something of an intermediate translation, a literal mapping that isn't exactly English, but that uses English words/elements to better show the Hebrew's word construction.

Example: Genesis 1:1

Starting with the Hebrew:

> בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית בָּרָ֣א אֱלֹהִ֑ים אֵ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְאֵ֥ת הָאָֽרֶץ

We render the following transliteration:

> "beReshit bara Elohim et haShamayim veEt haAretz"

From there we create a hyper-literal mapping of the Hebrew to English-ish:

> "In-heading, created, Gods, ↳ the-heavens and-↳ the-land."

Which then informs the final translation, now using English word order and grammar:

> "In heading, God created the heavens and the land."

Most students will recognize the above as an interlinear, which remains accessible in the reader app so that the curious can see the exact chain of translation decisions.
