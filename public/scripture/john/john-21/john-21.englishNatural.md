When therefore they had meal-shared, The Savior (Jesus) says to the Hearer (Simon) Stone (Peter), "Hearer (Simon) He—is-Gracious (John), do you god-love me more than these?" He says to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I brother-love you." He says to him, "Feed these lambs of mine." He says to him again the second time, "Hearer (Simon) He—is-Gracious (John), do you god-love me?" He says to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I brother-love you." He says to him, "Shepherd these sheep of mine." He says to him the third time, "Hearer (Simon) He—is-Gracious (John), do you brother-love me?" The Stone (Peter) was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you brother-love me?" And he says to him, "Lord, you know all; you know that I brother-love you." He says to him, "Feed these sheep of mine."

"Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and you walked where you wanted; but when you grow old, you will stretch out those hands of yours, and another will gird you and will carry where you want not."
