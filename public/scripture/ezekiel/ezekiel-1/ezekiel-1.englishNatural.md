And it was in year thirty,
in the fourth, in the five to the month,
and I in the midst of the exile upon river of Ancient (Kebar),
the heavens
were opened, and I saw visions of God.

In the five to the month,
it-was the year the fifth
to the exile of the king He-Establishes (Jehoiachin).

The word of He-Who-Is was being to God-Strengthens (Ezekiel) 
son of Contempt (Buzi), the priest,
in the land of Chaldeans upon river of Ancient (Kebar),
and it was upon him there hand of He-Who-Is.

And I saw and behold a wind storm coming from the north,
a great cloud, and fire flashing,
and brightness to it all-around,
and from its midst like an eye of the glowing-metal from the midst of the fire.

And from its midst a likeness of four living-things;
and this their appearance,
a likeness of human to them.

And four faces to one,
and four wings to one, to them.

And their legs were a leg straight,
and the palm of their legs like the palm of the leg of a calf,
and sparkling like an eye of polished bronze.

And hands of a human from under their wings
over four of their sides;
and their faces and their wings to four of them.

Joining woman to her sister their wings;
they went-around not in their going;
man to the side of his face they went.

And the likeness of their faces:
the face of a human,
and the face of a lion to the right to four of them,
and the face of an ox from the left to four of them,
and the face of an eagle to four of them.

And their faces and their wings separated upward;
two joining man to man,
and two covering their bodies.

And man to the side of his face they went;
to which it was there the wind to go they went;
they went-around not in their going.

And the likeness of the living-things, their appearance
like coals of burning fire,
like the appearance of The Torches she was going between the living-things;
and brightness to the fire,
and from the fire positioned lightning.

And the living-things sprinting and returning like the appearance of The Flashing.

And I saw the living-things,
and behold one wheel in the land,
beside the living-things, to four of his faces.

The appearance of the wheels and their work,
like an eye of gold-stone,
and one likeness to four of them,
and their appearance and their work
like which it was the wheel in the midst of the wheel.

Over four of their sides they went in their going;
they went-around not in their going.

And their rims and height to them,
and fear to them,
and their rims full of eyes all-around to four of them.

And in the going of the living-things, the wheels went beside them,
and in the being-lifted of the living-things from over the land, the wheels were lifted.

Over which it was there, the wind to go, they went,
there, the wind to go,
and the wheels were lifted alongside them,
that the wind of the living-thing in the wheels.

In their going they went,
and in their standing they stood,
and in their being-lifted from over the land
the wheels were lifted to alongside them,
that the wind of the living-thing, in the wheels.

And the likeness of a hammering-out, over the heads of the living-thing,
like an eye of The Crystal, The Fearsome,
stretched-out over their heads from above.

And under the hammering-out their wings straight,
woman to her sister;
two to a man, a covering to them,
and two to a man, a covering to them their bodies.

And I heard the voice of their wings,
like the voice of many waters,
like the voice of All-Powerful (Shaddai),
in their going the voice of tumult, like the voice of a camp;
in their standing they sank their wings.

And it was a voice from over the hammering-out which over his head;
in their standing they sank their wings.

And from over the hammering-out which over his head
like the appearance of a stone of sapphire the likeness of a throne;
and over the likeness of the throne a likeness
like the appearance of a human from upward over him.

And I saw like an eye of glowing-metal,
like an appearance of fire a house to all-around
from the appearance of his loins and upward,
and from the appearance of his loins and downward
I saw like an appearance of fire,
and brightness to him all-around.

Like the appearance of the bow which is in the cloud in the day of rain,
so the appearance of the brightness all-around;
that the appearance of the likeness of the glory of He-Who-Is.
And I saw and I fell over my face,
and I heard a voice speaking.
