And-it-was in-thirty year,
in-fourth, in-five to-the-month,
and-I in-midst-of- the-exile upon- River-of- Ancient (Kebar),
they-were-opened the-skies,
and-I-saw visions-of Gods.

In-the-five to-the-month,
it the-year the-fifth
to-exile-of the-king He_Establishes (Jehoiachin).

Being was word-of- He_Who_Is (YHWH) to- God_Strengthens (Ezekiel) 
son-of- Contempt (Buzi), the-priest,
in-land-of Chaldeans over- River-of- Ancient (Kebar),
and-it-was over-him there hand-of- He_Who_Is (YHWH).

And-I-saw and-behold, wind storm coming from- the-north,
cloud great, and-fire flashing,
and-brightness to-it all_around,
and-from-midst-its like-eye-of the-glowing_metal from-midst-of the-fire.

And-from-midst-its likeness-of four living_beings;
and-this appearance-their,
likeness-of Earth (Adam) to-them.

And-four faces to-one,
and-four wings to-one to-them.

And-legs-their leg straight,
and-palm-of legs-their like-palm-of leg-of calf,
and-sparkling like-eye-of bronze polished.

And-hands-of Earth (Adam) from-under wings-their
over four-of sides-their;
and-faces-their and-wings-their to-four-them.

joining woman to- sister-her wings-their;
not- they-went_around in-going-their;
man to- side-of faces-his they-went.

And-likeness-of faces-their:
faces-of Earth (Adam),
and-faces-of lion to- the-right to-four-of-them,
and-faces-of- ox from-the-left to-four-of-them,
and-faces-of- eagle to-four-of-them.

And-faces-their and-wings-their separated from-to-upward;
to-man two joining man,
and-two covering ↳ bodies-their.

And-man to- side-of faces-his they-went;
to which it-was- there the-wind to-go they-went;
not they-went-around in-going-their.

And-likeness-of the-living_beings, 
appearance-their like-coals-of- fire burning,
like-appearance-of the-torches she going between the-living_beings;
and-brightness to-the-fire,
and-from- the-fire brought_out lightning.

And-the-living-beings sprinting and-returning like-appearance-of the-flashing.

And-I-saw the-living-beings,
and-behold wheel one in-land,
beside the-living-beings, to-four-of faces-his.

appearance-of the-wheels and-work-their,
like-eye-of golden_stone,
and-likeness one to-four-of-them,
and-appearance-their and-work-their
like-which it-was the-wheel in-midst-of the-wheel.

over- four-of sides-their they-went in-going-their;
not they-went-around in-going-their.

And-rims-their and-height to-them,
and-fear to-them,
and-rims-their full-of eyes all_around to-four-of-them.

And-in-going-of the-living-beings, they-went the-wheels beside-them,
and-in-being-lifted-of the-living-beings from-over the-land, they-were-lifted the-wheels.

over which it-was- there, the-wind to-go they-went
there, the-wind to-go,
and-the-wheels they-were-lifted to-alongside-them,
that wind-of the-living-being, in-wheels.

In-going-their they-went,
and-in-standing-their they-stood,
and-in-being-lifted-their from-over the-land
they-were-lifted the-wheels to-alongside-them,
that wind-of the-living-being, in-wheels.

And-likeness-of over- heads-of the-living-being hammering_out,
like-eye-of the-crystal the-fearsome,
stretched-out over- heads-their from-to-upward.

And-under the-hammering_out wings-their straight,
woman to- sister-her;
to-man two, covering to-them,
and-to-man two, covering to-them ↳ bodies-their.

And-I-heard ↳ voice-of wings-their,
like-voice-of waters many,
like-voice-of- All_Powerful (Shaddai),
in-going-their voice-of tumult, like-voice-of camp;
in-standing-their they-sank wings-their.

And-it-was- voice from-over to-the-hammering_out which over- head-his;
in-standing-their they-sank wings-their.

And-from-over to-the-hammering_out which over- head-his
like-appearance-of stone-of- sapphire likeness-of throne;
and-over likeness-of the-throne 
likeness like-appearance-of Earth (Adam), over-him from-to-upward.

And-I-saw like-eye-of glowing_metal,
like-appearance-of- fire house- to all_around
from-appearance-of loins-his and-to-upward,
and-from-appearance-of loins-his and-to-downward
I-saw like-appearance-of- fire,
and-brightness to-him all_around.

like-appearance-of the-bow which it-is in-cloud in-day-of the-rain,
so appearance-of the-brightness all_around;
he appearance-of likeness-of glory-of- He_Who_Is (YHWH).
And-I-saw and-I-fell over- faces-my,
and-I-heard voice speaking.
