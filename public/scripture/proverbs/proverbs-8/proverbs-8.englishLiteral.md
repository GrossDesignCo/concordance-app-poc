Does-not Wisdom will-call_out? 
and-Understanding will-give voice-her? In-head-of heights overlooking way, 
between paths she-has-stationed_herself; To-hand-of gates, to-mouth-of city, 
incoming-of openings she-cries_out;

He_Who_Is acquired-me, heading-of way-his, 
before from-works-his from-that_time. 
From-the_age was-poured_out-I, 
from-heading, from-east-of land. 
In-nothing, depths, was-born-I; 
in-nothing, springs, heavy_with waters. 
In-before mountains were-sunk, 
to-face-of hills was-born-I. 
Until not had-made land and-outsides, 
and-head-of dusts-of world. 
In-establishing-his heavens, there I; 
in-inscribing-his circle over face-of deep.
