Does-not Wisdom will-call_out? 
and-Understanding will-give voice-her?

In-head-of heights overlooking way, 
between paths she-has-stationed_herself;

To-hand-of gates, to-mouth-of city, 
incoming-of openings she-cries_out;

He_Who_Is (YHWH) acquired-me, heading-of way-his, 
before from-works-his from-that_time.

From-the_age was-poured_out-I, 
from-heading, from-east-of land.

In-nothing, abyss, was-birthed-I; 
in-nothing, springs, heavy_with waters.

In-before mountains were-sunk, 
to-face-of hills was-birthed-I.

Until not he-had-made land and-outsides, 
and-head-of dusts-of world.

In-establishing-his skies, there I; 
in-inscribing-his circle over face-of abyss.

In-strengtheng-his clouds from-above; 
in-being_strong fountains-of abyss.

In-placing-his to-the-sea his-decree, and-waters not they-will-pass- his-mouth; 
in-inscribing-his foundations-of land.

and-I-was beside-him master_craftsman, 
and-I-was darlings day day, 
laughing to-faces-his in-all- time.

laughing in-world-of his-land, 
and-my-darlings ↳ sons-of Earth (Adam).
