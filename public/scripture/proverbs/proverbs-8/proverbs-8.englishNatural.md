Does not Wisdom call-out? 
and Understanding give her voice? In head of heights overlooking a way, 
between paths she has stationed-herself; To the hand of gates, to the mouth of a city, 
incoming of openings she cries-out;

He-Who-Is acquired me, the heading of his way, 
before his works from that-time. 
From the-age I was poured-out, 
from the heading, from the-east of land. 
In nothing, abyss, I was born; 
in nothing, springs, heavy-with waters. 
In before mountains were sunk, 
to the-face-of hills I was born. 
Until not had made land and outsides, 
and the head of dusts of world. 
In his establishing heavens, there I; 
in his inscribing circle over the face of the abyss.
