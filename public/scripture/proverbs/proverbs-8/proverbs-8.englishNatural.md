Does not Wisdom call-out? 
and Understanding give her voice?

In the head of heights overlooking a way, 
between paths she has stationed-herself;

To the hand of gates, to the mouth of a city, 
incoming of openings she cries-out;

He-Who-Is (YHWH) acquired me, the heading of his way, 
before his works from that-time.

From the-age I was poured-out, 
from the heading, from the-east of land.

In nothing, abyss, I was birthed; 
in nothing, springs, heavy-with waters.

In before mountains were sunk, 
to the-face-of hills I was birthed.

Unto he had made not land and outsides, 
and the head of dusts of the world.

In his establishing skies, there I; 
in his inscribing a circle over the face of the abyss.

In his strengthening clouds from above; 
in being-strong the fountains of the abyss.

In his placing to the sea his decree, and the waters will pass his mouth not; 
in his inscribing the foundations of land.

and I was beside him a master-craftsman, 
and I was darlings day day, 
laughing to his faces in all time.

laughing in the world of his land, 
and my darlings the sons of Earth (Adam).
