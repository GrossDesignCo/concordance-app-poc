And-were-finished the-skies, and-the-land, and-all- their-host.

And-finished Gods in-day the-seventh, his-work which made; 
and-stopped in-day the-seventh, from-all his-work which made.

And-blessed Gods â†³ day the-seventh, and-sanctified him; 
that in-it stopped from-all his-work, which created Gods to-make.
