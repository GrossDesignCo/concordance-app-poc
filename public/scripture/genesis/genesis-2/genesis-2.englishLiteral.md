And-were-finished the-skies, and-the-land, and-all- their-host.

And-finished Gods in-day the-seventh, his-work which made; 
and-stopped in-day the-seventh, from-all his-work which made.

And-blessed Gods ↳ day the-seventh, and-sanctified him; 
that in-it stopped from-all his-work, which created Gods to-make.

These birthings the-skies and-the-land, in-being-created-them; 
in-day making He_Who_Is Gods land and-skies.

And-all shrub the-field not-yet will-be in-the-land, and-all herb the-field not-yet will-grow; for not caused_to_rain He_Who_Is Gods over the-land, and-Human not_exist to-serve ↳ the-soil.

And-mist will-go_up from- the-land, and-gave_drink ↳ all- face-of the-soil.

And-formed He_Who_Is Gods ↳ the-human dust from- the-soil; 
and-blew in-his-nostrils breath-of lives, 
and-was the-human to-throat living.

And-planted He_Who_Is Gods garden in-Eden from-east, 
and-set there ↳ the-human which formed.
