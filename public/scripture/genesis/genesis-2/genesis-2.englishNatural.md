And finished were the skies, and the land, and all their host.

And God finished in the seventh day, his work which he made; 
and stopped in the seventh day, from all his work which he made.

And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; 
that in it he stopped from all his work, which God created, made.

These are the birthings of the skies and the land, in their being created; 
in the day He-Who-Is God made land and skies.

And all shrub of the field was not yet in the land, and all herb of the field had not yet grown; for He-Who-Is God had not caused it to rain over the land, and Human was not there, to serve the soil.

And a mist went up from the land, and gave drink to all the face of the soil.

And He-Who-Is God formed the human, dust from the soil; 
and blew into his nostrils the breath of life, 
and the human was a living throat.

And He-Who-Is God planted a garden in Eden from the east, 
and set there the human which he formed.
