And Rest (Noah) built an altar to He-Who-Is;
and took from all the beast the clean
and from all the flyer the clean,
and caused to go-up goings-up on the altar.

And He-Who-Is winded the wind of the restful;
and He-Who-Is said to his heart,

"I will add not, to curse again the soil,
in the passing-through of the human,
for the forming of the heart of the human, bad from his youth;
and I will add not again to strike all living,
as which I have done.

Still all the days of the land,
seed and harvest,
and cold and heat,
and summer and winter,
and day and night
they will cease not."
