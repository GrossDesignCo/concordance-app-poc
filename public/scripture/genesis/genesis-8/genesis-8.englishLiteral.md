And-built Rest (Noah) altar to-He_Who_Is (YHWH);
and-took from-all the-beast the-clean
and-from-all the-flyer the-clean,
and-caused-to-go_up goings_up on-the-altar.

And-winded He_Who_Is (YHWH) ↳ wind-of the-restful;
and-said He_Who_Is (YHWH) to- his-heart,

"not- I-will-add, to-treat-lightly again ↳ the-earth,
in-passing_through-of the-Earth (Adam),
for forming heart-of the-Earth (Adam), bad from-his-youth;
and-not- I-will-add again to-strike ↳ all- living,
as-which I-have-done.

Still all- days-of the-land,
seed and-harvest,
and-cold and-heat,
and-summer and-winter,
and-day and-night
not they-will-cease."
