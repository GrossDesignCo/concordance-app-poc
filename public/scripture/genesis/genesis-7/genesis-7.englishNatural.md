And Rest (Noah), a son of six hundred years,
and the flood was waters over the land.

And Rest (Noah) came,
and his sons and his woman and the women of his sons with him,
to the ark,
from the face of the waters of the flood.

From the beast the clean 
and from the beast which is not clean, 
and from the bird 
and all which creeps over the soil,

two, two, they came to Rest (Noah) to the ark,
male and female,
as which God commanded Rest (Noah).

And it was to seven of the days,
and waters of the flood were over the land.

In the year of six hundred years to the life of Rest (Noah),
in the month the second,
in seven ten days to the month, in this day
were broken-open all the fountains of the great abyss,
and the windows of the skies were opened.

And the rain was over the land,
forty days and forty nights.

In the bone of the day the this,
Rest (Noah) came,
and Name (Shem) and Hot (Ham) and Spacious (Japheth) the sons of Rest (Noah),
and the woman of Rest (Noah) and the three women of his sons with them,
to the ark;

they, and all the living-being to its kind,
and all the beast to its kind,
and all the creeping-thing the creeping over the land to its kind,
and all the flier to its kind,
all sparrow, all wing.
