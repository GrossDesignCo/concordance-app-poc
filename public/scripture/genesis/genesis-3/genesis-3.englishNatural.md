And the snake was shrewd, out of every living-thing of the field, which He-Who-Is God had made. 
And he said to the woman, "Is-it-so, that God said 'You shall eat not from any tree of the garden'?"

And the woman said to the snake, "From the fruit of the tree of the garden we may eat."

And the woman said, "'From the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,' God said, 'You shall eat from it not, and you shall touch it not, lest you should die'."

And the snake said to the woman, "Dying? You shall die not."
That God is knowing, that in the day of you eating from it, 
and your eyes will be opened; and you-all will be as God, knowing good and bad."

And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was desirable to the eyes, and coveted was the tree to make wise, and she took from its fruit and ate, and gave also to her man with her; and he ate.

And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed leaf of fig, and made for themselves girdings.

And they heard the voice of He-Who-Is God, walking in Garden to the wind of the day; 
and the human and his wife hid, from the face of He-Who-Is God, in the midst of the tree of Garden.

And He-Who-Is God called-out to the human,
and said to him, "Where are you?"

And he said, 
"Your voice, I heard, in Garden, and I feared; 
that naked, I am, and I hid."

And he said, 
"Who declared to you that naked you are? 
Is it from the tree, which I command you not to eat from it, you eat?"

And the human said, "The woman which you gave with me; she gave to me from the tree, and I ate."

And He-Who-Is God said to the woman, "What is this you have made?" 
And the woman said, "The snake, he deceived me, and I ate."

And He-Who-Is God said to the snake, 
"Because you have made this, cursed are you 
from every beast and from every living-thing of the field; 
on your belly you will walk, 
and dust you will eat, 
all the days of your life.

And enmity I will place 
between you and between the woman, 
and between your seed and between her seed; 
he will bruise your head, 
and you will bruise his heel."

To the woman he said, 
"Multiplying, I will multiply your pain and your pregnancy; 
in pain you will birth sons; 
and to your man your attraction, 
and he will rule in you."
