And-the-snake was shrewd, from-all living_thing-of the-field, which made, He_Who_Is Gods. 
And-said, to the-woman, "Is_it_so, that said Gods, 'Not you-shall-eat from-all tree the-garden'?"

And-said, the-woman, to, the-snake, "from-fruit-of tree the-garden, we-eat."

And-said the-woman, "'From-fruit-of the-tree which in-midst-of the-garden,' said Gods, 'Not you-shall-eat from-it, and-not you-shall-touch in-it, lest you-shall-die'."

And-said the-snake to the-woman, "Not- dying you-shall-die."

That knowing Gods, that in-day eating-you from-it, and-will-be-opened your-eyes; and-you_all-will-be as-Gods, knowing good and-bad."

And-saw the-woman that good the-tree for-food, and-that desirable- it to-the-eyes, and-coveted the-tree to-make-wise, and-took from-fruit-its and-ate, and-gave also- to-her-man with-her; and-ate.

And-opened-were eyes-of two-of-them, and-knew that naked they; and-sewed leaf-of fig, and-made to-them girdings.

And-heard ↳ voice He_Who_Is Gods, walking in-Garden to-wind the-day; 
and-hid the-human and-his-wife, from-face-of He_Who_Is Gods, in-midst-of tree the-garden.

And-called_out He_Who_Is Gods to- the-human,
and-said to-him, "Where?"

And-he-said, 
"↳ Your-voice, I-heard, in-Garden, and-I-feared; 
that- naked, I, and-I-hid."

And-he-said, 
"Who declared to-you that naked you? 
Is_it_from- the-tree, which I-command-you to-not eat- from-it, you-eat?"

And-he-said the-human, "The-woman which you-gave with-me; she she-gave- to-me from- the-tree, and-I-ate."

And-he-said He_Who_Is Gods to-the-woman, "What- this you-have-made?" 
And-she-said, the-woman "The-snake, he-deceived-me, and-I-ate."

And-he-said He_Who_Is Gods to- the-snake, 
"that you-made this, cursed you 
from-all beast and-from-all living_thing the-field; 
on- belly-your you-will_walk, 
and-dust you-will_eat, 
all- days lives-your.

And-enmity I-will_place 
between-you and-between the-woman, 
and-between seed-your and-between seed-her; 
he he-will-bruise-your head, 
and-you you-will-bruise-his heel."

To the-woman he-said, 
"Multiplying, I-will_multiply pain-your and-pregnancy-your; 
in-pain you-will_birth sons; 
and-to man-your fixation-your, 
and-he he-will_rule in-you."

And-to-Human (Adam) he-said, 
"That you-listened to-voice wife-your, 
and-you-ate from the-tree, 
which I-commanded-you to-say, 'Not you-will-eat from-it'; 
cursed the-soil in-passing_through-your; 
in-pain you-will-eat, 
all days-of lives-your;"

And-thorn and-thistle it-will-grow to-you; 
and-you-will-eat ↳ herb the-field;

In-sweat_of your-face, you-will-eat bread, 
until your-return to the-soil; 
that from-her you-were-taken, 
that dust you, 
and-to dust you-will-return."

And-he-called_out the-human name wife-his Life_Giver (Eve); that she was Mother all Living.

And-he-made He_Who_Is Gods to-Human (Adam) and-to-woman-his; tunics skin and-he-clothed-them.

And-he-said He_Who_Is Gods, 
"Behold, the-human has-become as-one 
from-us to-know good and-bad; 
and-now —or-else he-will-send hand-his 
and-take also from-tree the-lives 
and-eat and-live to-the_age—

And-he-sent-him He_Who_Is Gods from-Garden Delight (Eden); 
to-serve ↳ the-soil which was-taken from-there.

And-he-banished ↳ the-human; 
and-he-caused-to-dwell from-east to-Garden Delight (Eden) ↳ the-Guardians_of_the_Approach; 
and-↳ flame the-sword, the-overturning, 
to-keep ↳ way tree the-lives.
