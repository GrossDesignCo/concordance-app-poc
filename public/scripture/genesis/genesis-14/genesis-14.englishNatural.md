And the king of Devastation (Sodom) went out to meet him after his return from the striking-down of Sheaf-Binder (Chedorlaomer) 
and the kings which were with him,
to the valley of Level (Shaveh), it is the Valley of the King.

And King-of-My Righteousness (Melchizedek), king of Peace (Salem), 
brought out bread and wine; 
and he was priest to G. Most-High.
