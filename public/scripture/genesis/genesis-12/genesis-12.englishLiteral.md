And-said He_Who_Is (YHWH) to- Exalted-Father (Abram), 
"walk- to-you from-land-your and-from-kindred-your and-from-house-of father-your, 
to- the-land which I-will-cause-you-to-see.

and-I-will-make-you to-nation great 
and-I-will-bless-you and-I-will-make-great your-name, 
and-be blessing."

and-I-will-bless ones-blessing-you, 
and-one-treating-you-lightly, I-will-curse, 
and-they-will-be-blessed in-you, all families-of the-earth.
