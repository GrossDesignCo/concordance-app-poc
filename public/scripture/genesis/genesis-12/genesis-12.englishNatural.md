said And He-Who-Is (YHWH) to Exalted-Father (Abram), 
"Walk to yourself from your land and from your kindred and from the house of your father, 
to the land which I will cause you to see.

and I will make you into a nation great 
and I will bless you and I will make great your name, 
and be a blessing."

And I will bless the ones blessing you, 
and the one treating you lightly, I will curse, 
and they will be blessed in you, all the families of the earth.
