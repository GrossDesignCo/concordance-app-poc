And it was, that the human began to multiply over the face of the soil;
and daughters were birthed to them.

And the sons of God saw the daughters of Human (Adam),
that they were good;
and they took to themselves women, from all which they chose.

And He-Who-Is said, "My Wind will judge not in the human to the-age,
in moreover he is flesh;
and his days will be a hundred and twenty years."

The fallen-ones were in the land in those
days; and also after so,
which the sons of God came to the daughters of Human (Adam),
and to them they birthed the mighty-ones,
which from the-age, men of the name.

And He-Who-Is saw that the bad of Human (Adam) was multiplying in the land,
and all the forming of thoughts of his heart, only bad, all the day.

And He-Who-Is relented, that he made Human (Adam) in the land,
and it grieved him to his heart.

And He-Who-Is said, "I will wipe-out the human which I created
from over the face of the soil,
from human unto beast, unto creeping-thing, and unto bird of the skies;
for I have relented that I have made them."

And Rest (Noah) found grace in the eyes of He-Who-Is.

These are the birthings of Rest (Noah);

Rest (Noah), a man righteous, blameless he was in his generation;
Rest (Noah) walked-with the God.

And Rest (Noah) birthed three sons:
Name (Shem), and Hot (Ham), and Spacious (Japheth).

And the land corrupted to the face of God,
and the land filled-with violence.

And God saw the land,
and behold it had corrupted;
that all flesh had corrupted its way over the land.

And God said to Rest (Noah),
"The end of all flesh has come to my face;
that the land is full of violence from their faces;
and behold me destroying the land."

Make for yourself an ark of trees of gopher;
nests you shall make the ark,
and you shall cover it from inside and from outside with the covering.

And this which you shall make it:
three hundred cubits the length of the ark,
fifty cubits its breadth,
and thirty cubits its height.

A illunination you shall make for the ark,
and to a cubit you shall finish it from upward;
and the opening of the ark in its side you shall set;
lower second and third you shall make it.

And I, behold me, bringing the flood waters over the land,
to destroy all flesh which in it, the wind of life from under the skies;
all which in the land will expire.

And I will stand-up my covenant with you;
and you shall come to the ark,
you and your sons and your woman and the women of your sons with you.

And from all the living, from all flesh,
two from all you shall bring to the ark,
to keep-alive with you;
male and female they will be.

From the bird to its kind and from the beast to its kind,
from all creeping-thing of the soil to its kind,
two from all they will come to you,
to keep-alive.

And you take to yourself, from all food which is eaten,
and you shall gather to you;
and it will be for you and for them for food.

And Rest (Noah) made;
like all which God commanded him,
so he made.
