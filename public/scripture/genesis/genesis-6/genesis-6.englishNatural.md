and daughters were birthed to them.

And the sons of God saw the daughters of Human,
that they were good;

in moreover he is flesh;
and his days will be a hundred and twenty years."

which the sons of God came to the daughters of Human,
and to them they birthed the mighty-ones,
which from the-age, men of the name.
