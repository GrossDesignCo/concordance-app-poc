And it was, that the human began to multiply over the face of the soil;
and daughters were birthed to them.

And the sons of God saw the daughters of Human (Adam),
that they were good;
and they took to themselves women, from all which they chose.

And He-Who-Is said, "My Wind will judge not in the human to the-age,
in moreover he is flesh;
and his days will be a hundred and twenty years."

The fallen-ones were in the land in those
days; and also after so,
which the sons of God came to the daughters of Human (Adam),
and to them they birthed the mighty-ones,
which from the-age, men of the name.

And He-Who-Is saw that the bad of Human (Adam) was multiplying in the land,
and all the forming of thoughts of his heart, only bad, all the day.

And He-Who-Is relented, that he made Human (Adam) in the land,
and it grieved him to his heart.

And He-Who-Is said, "I will wipe-out the human which I created
from over the face of the ground,
from human unto beast, unto creeping-thing, and unto bird of the skies;
for I have relented that I have made them."

And Rest (Noah) found grace in the eyes of He-Who-Is.

These are the birthings of Rest (Noah);

Rest (Noah), a man righteous, blameless he was in his generation;
Rest (Noah) walked-with the God.
And Rest (Noah) birthed three sons:
Name (Shem), and Hot (Ham), and Spacious (Japheth).

And the land corrupted to the face of God,
and the land filled-with violence.

And God saw the land,
and behold it had corrupted;
that all flesh had corrupted its way over the land.
