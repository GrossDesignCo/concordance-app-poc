And-it-was, that- began the-human to-multiply over- face-of the-soil;
and-daughters were-birthed to-them.

And-they-saw sons- the-Gods ↳ daughters-of the-human,
that good they;
and-they-took to-them women, from-all which they-chose.

And-he-said He_Who_Is, "not- will-judge my-wind in-the-human to-the_age,
in-moreover he flesh;
and-they-will-be his-days hundred and-twenty year."

The-fallen_ones were in-the-land in-the-days the-those;
and-also after- so,
which they-came sons-of the-Gods to daughters-of the-Human (Adam),
and-they-birthed to-them they the-mighty_ones,
which from-the_age, men-of the-name.

And-he-saw He_Who_Is that multiplying-was bad-of the-human in-the-land,
and-all- forming-of thoughts-of heart-his, only bad, all- the-day.

And-he-relented He_Who_Is, that- he-made ↳ the-human in-the-land,
and-it-grieved-him to- heart-his.

And-he-said He_Who_Is, "I-will-wipe_out ↳ the-human which- I-created
from-over face-of the-ground,
from-human unto- beast, unto- creeping_thing, and-unto- bird-of the-skies;
that I-have-relented that I-have-made-them."

And-Rest (Noah) found grace in-eyes-of He_Who_Is.

These birthings-of Rest (Noah);

Rest (Noah), man righteous, blameless he-was in-generation-his;
↳ the-Gods walked-with- Rest (Noah).

And-he-birthed Rest (Noah) three sons:
↳ Name (Shem), and-↳ Hot (Ham), and-↳ Spacious (Japheth).

And-it-corrupted the-land to-face-of the-Gods,
and-it-filled the-land violence.

And-he-saw Gods ↳ the-land,
and-behold it-had-corrupted;
that- had-corrupted all- flesh ↳ way-its over- the-land.
