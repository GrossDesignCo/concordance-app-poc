And-it-was, that- began the-human to-multiply over- face-of the-soil;
and-daughters were-birthed to-them.

And-they-saw sons- the-Gods ↳ daughters-of the-human,
that good they;
and-they-took to-them women, from-all which they-chose.

And-he-said He_Who_Is, "not- will-judge my-wind in-the-human to-the_age,
in-moreover he flesh;
and-they-will-be his-days hundred and-twenty year."

The-fallen_ones were in-the-land in-the-days the-those;
and-also after- so,
which they-came sons-of the-Gods to daughters-of the-Human (Adam),
and-they-birthed to-them they the-mighty_ones,
which from-the_age, men-of the-name.

And-he-saw He_Who_Is that multiplying-was bad-of the-human in-the-land,
and-all- forming-of thoughts-of heart-his, only bad, all- the-day.

And-he-relented He_Who_Is, that- he-made ↳ the-human in-the-land,
and-it-grieved-him to- heart-his.

And-he-said He_Who_Is, "I-will-wipe_out ↳ the-human which- I-created
from-over face-of the-soil,
from-human unto- beast, unto- creeping_thing, and-unto- bird-of the-skies;
that I-have-relented that I-have-made-them."

And-Rest (Noah) found grace in-eyes-of He_Who_Is.

These birthings-of Rest (Noah);

Rest (Noah), man righteous, blameless he-was in-generation-his;
↳ the-Gods walked-with- Rest (Noah).

And-he-birthed Rest (Noah) three sons:
↳ Name (Shem), and-↳ Hot (Ham), and-↳ Spacious (Japheth).

And-it-corrupted the-land to-face-of the-Gods,
and-it-filled the-land violence.

And-he-saw Gods ↳ the-land,
and-behold it-had-corrupted;
that- had-corrupted all- flesh ↳ way-its over- the-land.

And-he-said Gods to-Rest (Noah),
"end-of all- flesh coming to-face-my;
that- is-full the-land violence from-faces-their;
and-behold-me destroying ↳ the-land."

Make to-you ark-of trees-of- gopher;
nests you-shall-make ↳ the-ark,
and-you-shall-cover her from-house and-from-outside with-the-covering.

And-this which you-shall-make her:
three hundreds cubit length-of the-ark,
fifty cubit breadth-her,
and-thirty cubit height-her.

illunination you-shall-make to-the-ark,
and-to- cubit you-shall-finish-her from-to-upward;
and-opening-of the-ark in-side-her you-shall-set;
lower second and-third you-shall-make-her.

And-I, behold-me, bringing ↳ the-flood waters over- the-land,
to-destroy all- flesh which- in-him, wind-of lives from-under the-skies;
all which- in-the-land will-expire.

And-I-will-stand_up ↳ covenant-my with-you;
and-you-shall-come to- the-ark,
you and-sons-your and-woman-your and-women-of- sons-your with-you.

And-from-all- the-living, from-all- flesh,
two from-all you-shall-bring to- the-ark,
to-keep_alive with-you;
male and-female they-will-be.

From-the-bird to-kind-his and-from- the-beast to-kind-her,
from-all creeping_thing-of the-soil to-kind-his,
two from-all they-will-come to-you,
to-keep_alive.

And-you take- to-you, from-all- food which it-is-eaten,
and-you-shall-gather to-you;
and-it-will-be to-you and-to-them to-food.

And-he-made Rest (Noah);
like-all which he-commanded him Gods,
so he-made.
