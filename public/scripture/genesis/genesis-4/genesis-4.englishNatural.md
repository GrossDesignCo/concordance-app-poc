And the human knew Living (Eve) his woman,
and she conceived and bore Acquired (Cain),
and said, "I have acquired a man with He-Who-Is."

And she added to her bearing, his brother Vapor (Abel).
And Vapor (Abel) was a shepherd of flock,
and Acquired (Cain) was a servant of soil.

And it was from the end of days;
And Acquired (Cain) brought from the fruit of the soil,
an offering to He-Who-Is.

And Vapor (Abel), he brought also, 
from the firstborn of his flock, and from their fat;
And He-Who-Is esteemed to Vapor (Abel), and to his offering.

And to Acquired (Cain) and to his offering, no esteeming;
And it was fuming-anger to Acquired (Cain) very-much, and his faces (eyes) fell.

And He-Who-Is said to Acquired (Cain),
"Why is it fuming-anger to you, and why have your faces (eyes) fallen?

And is there not, if you do-well, lifting-up?
And if you do-well not, to the door sin is crouching,
and to you is its fixation, and you will rule over it."
