And the Earth (Adam) knew Life (Eve) his woman,
and she conceived and bore Acquired (Cain),
and said, "I have acquired a man with He-Who-Is (YHWH)."

And she added to her birthing, his brother Vapor (Abel).
And Vapor (Abel) was a shepherd of flock,
and Acquired (Cain) was a servant of earth.

And it was from the end of days;
And Acquired (Cain) brought from the fruit of the earth,
an offering to He-Who-Is (YHWH).

And Vapor (Abel), he brought also, 
from the firstborn of his flock, and from their fat;
And He-Who-Is (YHWH) esteemed to Vapor (Abel), and to his offering.

And to Acquired (Cain) and to his offering, no esteeming;
And it was fuming-anger to Acquired (Cain) very-much, and his faces fell.

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to Acquired (Cain),
"Why is it fuming-anger to you, and why have your faces fallen?

And is there not, if you do-well, lifting-up?
And if you do-well not, to the opening sin is crouching,
and to you is its fixation, and you will rule over it."

And Acquired (Cain) said to Vapor (Abel) his brother;
and it was in their being in the field,
and Acquired (Cain) stood-up to Vapor (Abel) his brother,
and killed him.

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to Acquired (Cain),
"Where? Vapor (Abel), your brother?"

And he said, "I knew not, Am I keeper of my brother?"

And he said, "What have you done?
The voice of the blood of your brother is crying-out to me from the earth.
And now cursed are you, from the earth;
which has opened her mouth to take the blood of your brother, from your hand.
When you serve the earth,
it will add not, to give her ability to you;
wandering and fugitive you will be in the land."

And Acquired (Cain) said to He-Who-Is (YHWH),
"Great is my twisting, from lifting-up.
Behold, you have banished me this day, from over the face of the earth;
and from your faces I will be hidden;
and I will be wandering and fugitive in the land;
and it will be all finding me will kill me."

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to him, 
"Not so, all killing Acquired (Cain),
sevenfold it will be avenged."
And He-Who-Is (YHWH) set for Acquired (Cain) a sign,
so that not all striking-down him on finding him.

And Acquired (Cain) went out, from the face of He-Who-Is (YHWH);
and dwelt in the land of Wandering,
east of Delight.

And Acquired (Cain) knew his woman,
and she conceived and bore Dedicated (Enoch);
and he was building a city,
and he called-out the name of the city after the name of his son, Dedicated (Enoch).

And to Dedicated (Enoch) was born Fugitive (Irad);
and Fugitive (Irad) bore Smitten-of-God (Mehujael);
and Smitten-of-God (Mehujael) bore Man-of-God (Methusael);
and Man-of-God (Methusael) bore Powerful (Lamech).

And Powerful (Lamech) took to himself two women; 
the name of the one, Ornament (Adah), 
and the name of the second, Shadow (Zillah).

And Ornament (Adah) bore Stream (Jabal); 
he was father of tent dwelling, and cattle.
And the name of his brother, Music (Jubal); 
he was father of all lyre handling, and flute.
And Shadow (Zillah) also, she bore World Aquired (Tubal Cain),
smithing all cutting-straight bronze and iron; 
and the sister of World-Aquired (Tubal-Cain), Pleasant (Naamah).

And Powerful (Lamech) said to his women,
"Ornament (Adah) and Shadow (Zillah), hear my voice;
women of Powerful (Lamech), attend my speech;
that I have killed man to my wound,
and newborn to my stripe.
that Acquired (Cain) shall be avenged sevenfold,
and Powerful (Lamech) seventy and seven."

And Earth (Adam) knew his woman again; and she bore a son, and called-out his name "Appointed (Seth); that God has appointed me another seed instead of Vapor (Abel); that Acquired (Cain) killed him."

And to Appointed (Seth) also he was born a son; and he called-out his name Mortal (Enosh); then it began, to call-out in the name of He-Who-Is (YHWH).
