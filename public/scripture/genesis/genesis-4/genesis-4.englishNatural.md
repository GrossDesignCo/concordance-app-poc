And the human knew Living (Eve) his woman,
and she conceived and bore Acquired (Cain),
and said, "I have acquired a man with He-Who-Is."

And she added to her bearing, his brother Vapor (Abel).
And Vapor (Abel) was a shepherd of flock,
and Acquired (Cain) was a servant of soil.

And it was from the end of days;
And Acquired (Cain) brought from the fruit of the soil,
an offering to He-Who-Is.

And Vapor (Abel), he brought also, 
from the firstborn of his flock, and from their fat;
And He-Who-Is esteemed to Vapor (Abel), and to his offering.

And to Acquired (Cain) and to his offering, no esteeming;
And it was fuming-anger to Acquired (Cain) very-much, and his faces (eyes) fell.

And He-Who-Is said to Acquired (Cain),
"Why is it fuming-anger to you, and why have your faces (eyes) fallen?

And is there not, if you do-well, lifting-up?
And if you do-well not, to the door sin is crouching,
and to you is its fixation, and you will rule over it."

And Acquired (Cain) knew his woman,
and she conceived and bore Dedicated (Enoch);
and he was building a city,
and he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Dedicated (Enoch).

And to Dedicated (Enoch) was born Fugitive (Irad);
and Fugitive (Irad) bore Smitten-of-God (Mehujael);
and Smitten-of-God (Mehujael) bore Man-of-God (Methusael);
and Man-of-God (Methusael) bore Powerful (Lamech).

And Powerful (Lamech) took to himself two women; 
the name of the one, Ornament (Adah), 
and the name of the second, Shadow (Zillah).

And Ornament (Adah) bore Stream (Jabal); 
he was father of tent dwelling, and cattle.
And the name of his brother, Music (Jubal); 
he was father of all lyre handling, and flute.
And Shadow (Zillah) also, she bore World Aquired (Tubal Cain),
smithing all cutting-straight bronze and iron; 
and the sister of World-Aquired (Tubal-Cain), Pleasant (Naamah).

And Powerful (Lamech) said to his women,
"Ornament (Adah) and Shadow (Zillah), hear my voice;
women of Powerful (Lamech), attend my speech;
that I have killed Man to my wound,
and Newborn to my stripe.
that Acquired (Cain) shall be avenged sevenfold,
and Powerful (Lamech) seventy and seven."

And Human (Adam) knew his woman again; and she bore a son, and called his name Appointed (Seth); that God has appointed me another seed instead of Vapor (Abel); that Acquired (Cain) killed him.

And to Appointed (Seth) also he was born a son; and he called his name Mortal (Enosh); then it began, to call out in the name of He-Who-Is.
