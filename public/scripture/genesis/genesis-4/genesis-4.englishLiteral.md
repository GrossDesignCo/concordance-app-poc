And-the-human knew ↳ Living (Eve) his-woman,
and-she-conceived and-she-bore ↳ Acquired (Cain),
and-she-said, "I-have-acquired a-man ↳- He_Who_Is."

and-she-added to-her-bearing, ↳ his-brother ↳ Vapor (Abel).
And-he-was Vapor (Abel) shepherd flock,
and-Acquired (Cain) was servant soil.

And-it-was from-end-of days;
And-he-brought Acquired (Cain) from-fruit-of the-soil,
offering to-He_Who_Is.

And-Vapor (Abel), brought also he, 
from-firstborn-of his-flock, and-from-fat-of-them;
And-He-esteemed He_Who_Is to Vapor (Abel), and-to his-offering.

And-to Acquired (Cain) and-to his-offering, no esteeming;
And-it-was_fuming_anger to-Acquired (Cain) very_much, and-they-fell his-faces.

And-He-said He_Who_Is to- Acquired (Cain),
"Why it-fumed_angrily to-you, and-why they-fell your-faces?

And-is_there_not, if- you-do_well, lifting_up?
And-if not you-do_well, to-door sin crouching,
and-to-you its-fixation, and-you you-will-rule- over-it."
