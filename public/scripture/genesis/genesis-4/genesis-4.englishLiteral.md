And-the-human knew ↳ Living (Eve) his-woman,
and-she-conceived and-she-bore ↳ Acquired (Cain),
and-she-said, "I-have-acquired a-man ↳- He_Who_Is."

and-she-added to-her-birthing, ↳ his-brother ↳ Vapor (Abel).
And-he-was Vapor (Abel) shepherd flock,
and-Acquired (Cain) was servant soil.

And-it-was from-end-of days;
And-he-brought Acquired (Cain) from-fruit-of the-soil,
offering to-He_Who_Is.

And-Vapor (Abel), brought also he, 
from-firstborn-of his-flock, and-from-fat-of-them;
And-He-esteemed He_Who_Is to Vapor (Abel), and-to his-offering.

And-to Acquired (Cain) and-to his-offering, no esteeming;
And-it-was_fuming_anger to-Acquired (Cain) very_much, and-they-fell his-faces.

And-He-said He_Who_Is to- Acquired (Cain),
"Why it-fumed_angrily to-you, and-why they-fell your-faces?

And-is_there_not, if- you-do_well, lifting_up?
And-if not you-do_well, to-door sin crouching,
and-to-you its-fixation, and-you you-will-rule- over-it."

And-he-said Acquired (Cain) to Vapor (Abel) his-brother;
And-it-was in-their-being in-the-field,
and-he-stood_up Acquired (Cain) to- Vapor (Abel) his-brother,
and-he-killed-him.

And-he-said He_Who_Is to Acquired (Cain),
"Where? Vapor (Abel), your-brother?"

And-he-said, "Not I-knew, keeper-of my-brother I?"

And-he-said, "What you-did? Voice-of blood-of your-brother crying_out to-me from- the-soil.

And-now cursed you, from- the-ground;
which she-opened ↳ her-mouth to-take ↳ blood-of your-brother from-your-hand.

When you-serve ↳ the-ground,
not- it-will-add give- her-strength to-you;
wandering and-fugitive you-will-be in-the-land."

And-he-said Acquired (Cain) to He_Who_Is,
"Great my-twisting, from-lifting_up.
Behold, you-banished ↳-me the-day, from-over face-of the-ground;
and-from-your-face I-will-hide;
and-I-will-be wandering and-fugitive in-the-land;
and-it-will-be all- finding-me will-kill-me.

And-he-said to-him He_Who_Is, 
"Not-so, all- killing Acquired (Cain),
sevenfold it-will-be-avenged."
And-he-set He_Who_Is for-Acquired (Cain) sign,
for-not striking_down- ↳-him all- finding-him.

And-he-went-out Acquired (Cain), from-face-of He_Who_Is;
and-he-dwelt in-land- Wandering,
east- Delight.

And-he-knew Acquired (Cain) ↳ his-woman,
and-she-conceived and-she-bore ↳ Dedicated (Enoch);
and-he-was building city,
and-he-called name the-city as-name son-his, Dedicated (Enoch).

and-name the-second, Shadow (Zillah).

And-bore Ornament (Adah) ↳ Stream (Jabal);

"Ornament (Adah) and-Shadow (Zillah), hear voice-my;
women-of Powerful (Lamech), attend speech-my;
that man I-have-killed to-wound-my,
and-newborn to-stripe-my.

that sevenfold shall-be-avenged Acquired (Cain),
and-Powerful (Lamech) seventy and-seven."
