And it was bad to Dove (Jonah), a great bad; 
and it fumed angrily to him.

And he prayed to He-Who-Is and said, 
"Please He-Who-Is, was not this my word until I was over my soil? 
So moreover I preceded to flee to Breaking (Tarshish), 
that I knew that you are God gracious and compassionate, 
long of nostrils and great of steadfast-love 
and comforting over the bad.

And now He-Who-Is, take please my throat from me, 
that good-is my death, from my life."

And He-Who-Is said, "Is fuming-angrily the doing-well, to you?"

And Dove (Jonah) 
went-out from the city and sat from east to the city 
and made for him there a booth and sat under it in the shadow, 
until which he will see what will be in the city.
