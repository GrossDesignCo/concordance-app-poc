And it was bad to Dove (Jonah), a great bad; 
and it fumed angrily to him.

And he prayed to He-Who-Is (YHWH) and said, 
"Please He-Who-Is (YHWH), was not this my word unto I was over my earth? 
So moreover I preceded to flee to golden-stone (Tarshish), 
that I knew that you are God gracious and compassionate, 
long of nostrils and great of steadfast-love 
and comforting over the bad.

And now He-Who-Is (YHWH), take please my throat from me, 
that good-is my death, from my life."

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said, "Is fuming-angrily the doing-well, to you?"

And Dove (Jonah) 
went-out from the city and sat from east to the city 
and made for him there a booth and sat under it in the shadow, 
until which he will see what will be in the city.

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) God appointed a luscious-plant, 
and made it go-up from over to Dove (Jonah), 
to be a shadow over his head, 
to deliver to him from his bad; 
and Dove (Jonah) rejoiced over the luscious-plant a great joy.

And the God appointed a worm 
at the rising of the dawn to the next-day, 
and it struck-down the luscious-plant, 
and it withered.

And it was at the rising of the sun; 
and God appointed a wind, a scorching east-wind, 
and the sun struck over the head of Dove (Jonah), and he fainted; 
and he asked his throat to die, 
and he said, "Good-is my death from my life."

And God said to Dove (Jonah), "Is the doing-well fuming-angrily to you, over the luscious-plant?" 
And he said, "Doing-well is fuming-angrily to me, unto death."

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said, "You pitied over the luscious-plant, 
which you labored in it not, and you grew it not, 
yet son of a night it was and son of a night it perished.

And I, will I pity not over Dwelling-of-Fish (Nineveh), the city, the great, 
which there-is in her much more than two ten ten-thousand Earth (Adam), 
which knows not between his right-hand to his left-hand; and many beast?"
