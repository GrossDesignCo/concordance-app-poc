And-was-bad to- Dove (Jonah), bad great; 
and-fumed_angrily to-him.

And-prayed to- He_Who_Is and-said, 
"please He_Who_Is, is-not- this word-my until- being-my over- soil-my? 
over- so I-preceded to-flee Breaking (Tarshish), 
that I-knew that- you God- gracious and-compassionate, 
long nostrils and-great- steadfast_love 
and-comforting over- the-bad.

And-now He_Who_Is, take- please ↳ throat-my from-me, 
that good death-my, from-lives-my."

And-said He_Who_Is, "the-doing_well, fuming_angrily, to-you?"

And-went_out Dove (Jonah) from- the-city and-sat from-east to-the-city 
and-made to-him there booth and-sat under-her in-the-shadow, 
until which he-will-see what- will-be in-the-city.

And-appointed He_Who_Is- Gods luscious_plant, 
and-went_up from-over to-Dove (Jonah), 
to-be shadow over- head-his, 
to-deliver to-him from-bad-his; 
and-rejoiced Dove (Jonah) over- the-luscious_plant joy great.

And-appointed the-Gods worm 
at-rising_of the-dawn to-the-next_day, 
and-struck_down ↳ the-luscious_plant, 
and-withered.

And-was at-rising_of the-sun; 
and-appointed Gods wind, east_wind scorching, 
and-struck the-sun over- head Dove (Jonah), and-fainted; 
and-asked ↳ throat-his to-die, 
and-said, "good death-my from-lives-my."

And-said Gods to- Dove (Jonah), "the-doing_well fuming_angrily to-you, over- the-luscious_plant?" 
And-said, "doing_well fuming_angrily- to-me, until- death."

And-said He_Who_Is, "you pitied over- the-luscious_plant, 
which not- you-labored in-it and-not you-grew-it, 
yet-son-of- night was and-son-of- night perished.

And-I, not I-will-pity over- Dwelling_of_Fish (Nineveh), the-city, the-great, 
which there_is- in-her much from-two- ten ten_thousand Human (Adam), 
which not- knows between- right_hand-his to-left_hand-his; 
and-beast many?"
