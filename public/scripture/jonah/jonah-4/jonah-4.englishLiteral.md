And-was-bad to- Dove (Jonah), bad great; 
and-fumed_angrily to-him.

And-prayed to- He_Who_Is and-said, 
"please He_Who_Is, is-not- this word-my until- being-my over- soil-my? 
over- so I-preceded to-flee Breaking (Tarshish), 
that I-knew that- you God- gracious and-compassionate, 
long nostrils and-great- steadfast_love 
and-comforting over- the-bad.

And-now He_Who_Is, take- please â†³ throat-my from-me, 
that good death-my, from-lives-my."

And-said He_Who_Is, "the-doing_well, fuming_angrily, to-you?"

And-went_out Dove (Jonah) from- the-city and-sat from-east to-the-city 
and-made to-him there booth and-sat under-her in-the-shadow, 
until which he-will-see what- will-be in-the-city.
