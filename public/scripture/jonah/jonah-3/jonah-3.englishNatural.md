And the word of He-Who-Is was to Dove (Jonah) the second time, to say;

"Stand-up, go to Dwelling-of-Fish (Nineveh) the city the great, 
and call-out to her the calling-out 
which I am speaking to you.

And Dove (Jonah) stood-up, and went to Dwelling-of-Fish (Nineveh), 
according to the word of He-Who-Is.

And Dwelling-of-Fish (Nineveh) was a city great to God, 
a journey of three days.

And Dove (Jonah) began to enter into the city a journey of one day, 
and he called-out and said, 
"Yet forty days, 
and Dwelling-of-Fish (Nineveh) overturned."

And the men of Dwelling-of-Fish (Nineveh) believed in God, 
and called-out a fast, 
and clothed sackcloth, 
from their great and unto their small.

And the word touched to the king of Dwelling-of-Fish (Nineveh), 
and he stood-up from his throne, 
and he passed-through his robe from over him, 
and covered sackcloth, 
and sat over the ashes.

And he cried-out and said in Dwelling-of-Fish (Nineveh), 
from the decree of the king and his greats, to say, 
"The Human (Adam) and the beast, 
the cattle and the flock, 
they will taste not anything, 
they will graze not, 
and waters they will drink not;"

And they will be covered sackcloth, the Human (Adam) and the beast, 
and they will call-out to God in strength; 
and return man from his way the bad 
and from the violence which is in their hands.

Who knows? The God 
will return and will comfort, and turn 
from the burning of his nose, and we will perish not?
