And-was word-of He_Who_Is to- Dove (Jonah) second_time, to-say;

"Stand_up, go to- Dwelling_of_Fish (Nineveh), the-city, the-great, 
and-call_out to-her ↳ the-calling_out 
which I speaking to-you.

And-stood_up Dove (Jonah), and-went to- Dwelling_of_Fish (Nineveh), 
according-to-word-of He_Who_Is.

And-Dwelling_of_Fish (Nineveh) was city- great to-Gods, 
journey-of three days.

And-began Dove (Jonah) to-enter in-the-city journey-of day one, 
and-called_out and-said, 
"yet forty day, 
and-Dwelling_of_Fish (Nineveh) overturned."

And-believed men-of Dwelling_of_Fish (Nineveh) in-Gods, 
and-called_out- fast, 
and-clothed sackcloth, 
from-great-their and-unto- small-their.

And-touched the-word to- king-of Dwelling_of_Fish (Nineveh), 
and-stood_up from-throne-his, 
and-passed_through robe-his from-over-him, 
and-covered sackcloth, 
and-sat over- the-ashes.

And-cried_out and-said in-Dwelling_of_Fish (Nineveh), 
from-decree-of the-king and-greats-his, to-say, 
"the-human and-the-beast, 
the-cattle and-the-flock, 
not- they-will-taste anything, 
not- they-will-graze 
and-waters not- they-will-drink;

And-they-will-be-covered sackcloth,
the-human and-the-beast, 
and-they-will-call_out to- Gods in-strength; 
and-return man from-way-his the-bad 
and-from- the-violence which in-palms-their.

who- knows? he-will-return and-will-comfort the-Gods, 
and-turn from-burning-of nose-his,

and-not we-will-perish?"

And-saw the-Gods ↳ works-their, that- they-returned from-way-their the-bad; 
and-comforted the-Gods, over- the-bad which- he-spoke to-make to-them; and-not he-made.
