And the word of He-Who-Is was to Dove (Jonah) son of My-Truth, saying;

"Stand-up, go to Dwelling-of-Fish (Nineveh), the city, the great; 
and call-out over her, that their bad has come up before me."

And Dove (Jonah) stood-up, to flee to Breaking-ward, 
from the face of He-Who-Is, 
and went-down to Beautiful; 
and he found a ship going to Breaking; 
and he paid the fare of it, 
and went-down into it, to go with them to Breaking-ward, 
from the face of He-Who-Is.

And He-Who-Is hurled a great wind to the sea, 
and there was a great tempest in the sea, 
and the ship planned to be broken.

And the sailors feared, and cried-out, man to his god, 
and hurled the vessels which were in the ship to the sea, 
to lighten it from over them.

And Dove (Jonah) had gone down into the far-reaches of the ship; 
and he lay down and deeply-tranced.

And the chief sailor came to him, 
and said to him, "What is with you O sleeper? Stand-up, call-out to your God.

If so be that God will think upon us, that we may not perish."

And man said to his friend, "Go, 
and let us cause-to-fall lots, 
and let us know for whose sake this bad is to us."

And they caused-to-fall lots, and the lot fell over Dove (Jonah).

And they said to him, "Tell us to us, in which, for who the bad this is to us; 
What is your work? and from where come you? 
What is your land? and where 'from this people' are you?"

And he said to them, "A Hebrew am I; 
and He-Who-Is God of the skies I fear, 
which made the sea and the dry-ground."

And the men feared a great fear, 
and said to him, "What is this you have done?" 
that the men knew, that from the face of He-Who-Is he was fleeing, that he had said to them.

And He-Who-Is appointed a great fish to swallow Dove (Jonah); 
And Dove (Jonah) was in the bowels of the fish 
three days and three nights.
