And-prayed Dove (Jonah) to- He_Who_Is Gods-his from-bowels-of the-fish;

And-said, 
"I-called_out from-distress to-me to- He_Who_Is, 
and-answered-me; 
from-belly-of Hades I-cried_out, 
you-heard voice-my.

And-you-sent-me deep, in-heart-of seas; 
and-river surrounds-me; 
all- breakers-your and-waves-your, over-me passed.

And-I said, 
'I-am-driven_out from-before eyes-your; 
Only I-will-add, to-look to- temple-of holiness-your.'

Surrounded-me waters, unto- throat; 
abyss surrounds-me; 
reed binds, to-head-my.

I-went_down to-cutoffs-of mountains; 
the-earth, bars-her behind-me to-the_age; 
and-you-brought_up from-corruption life-my, He_Who_Is God-my.

In-fainting over-me throat-my, 
↳ He_Who_Is I-remembered; 
and-came to-you prayer-my, 
to- temple-of holiness-your.

Keepers-of vapors-of emptiness, 
steadfast_love-their they-forsake.

And-I with-voice-of thanksgiving, I-will-sacrifice- to-you; 
which I-vowed I-will-complete; 
salvation to-He_Who_Is.

And-said He_Who_Is to-the-fish, 
and-vomited ↳ Dove (Jonah) to- the-dry_ground.
