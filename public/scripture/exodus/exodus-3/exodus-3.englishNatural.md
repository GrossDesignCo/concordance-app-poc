And God said to Draws-Out (Moses), 
"I am which I am." 
And he said, "Thus you will say to the sons of Struggles-with-God (Israel), 
'I-Am has sent me to you.'"

And again God said to Draws-Out (Moses), 
"Thus you will say to the sons of Struggles-with-God (Israel), 
'He-Who-Is (YHWH), God of your fathers, 
the God of Father-of-Multitudes (Abraham), 
the God of He-Laughs (Isaac), 
and the God of Heel-Grasper (Jacob), 
has sent me to you;' 
this is my name to the-age, 
and this is my rememberance to generation of generation."
