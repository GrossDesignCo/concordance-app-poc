And He-Who-Is went-down in the cloud, 
and positioned himself with him there, 
and called-out the name of He-Who-Is.

And He-Who-Is passed through over his faces (eyes), 
and called-out, "He-Who-Is, He-Who-Is, God, compassionate, 
and gracious, long of nostrils, 
and abundant in steadfast-love 
and truth.
preserving steadfast-love for thousands, 
lifting-up twisting and transgression and sin, 
and clearing not he will clear, 
visiting twisting fathers on sons 
and on sons of sons, 
on third-ones and on fourth-ones."
