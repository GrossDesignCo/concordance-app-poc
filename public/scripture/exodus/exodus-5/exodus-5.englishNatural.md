And after Drawn-Out (Moses) and Light-Bringer (Aaron) came and said to Pharaoh, 
"Thus has said He-Who-Is (YHWH), the God of Struggles-with-God (Israel), 
'Send-out my people and they will feast to me in the wilderness.'"

And Pharaoh said, "Who is He-Who-Is (YHWH) 
which I will hear in his voice to send-out Struggles-with-God (Israel)? 
I have known not He-Who-Is (YHWH), 
and also Struggles-with-God (Israel) I will send-out not."
