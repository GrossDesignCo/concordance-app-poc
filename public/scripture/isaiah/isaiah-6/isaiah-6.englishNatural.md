In the year of the death of the king, He-my-Strength (Uzziah).

And I saw my Lord sitting over a throne, high and lifted-up, 
and his garments, filling the temple.

Burning-ones were standing above him; six wings to each one, in two he covers his faces (eyes), and in two he covers his feet, and in two he flies.

And this called-out to this, and said, 

"Holy, holy, holy, He-Who-Is (YHWH) of Hosts,
fullness of all the land is his glory."

And pillars of the thresholds shook from the voice of the caller, and the house was filled with smoke.

And I said, "Woe to me that I am silenced; 
that I, a man of unclean lips, 
and in the midst of a people of unclean lips I sit; 
that my eyes have seen the King, He-Who-Is (YHWH) of Hosts."


And flew to me one from the burning-ones 
and in his hand a live-coal he had taken with tongs from upon the altar.

And he touched it to my mouth,
and he said, "Behold, this has touched over your lips; 
and turned-aside your twisting, 
and your sin will be covered."
