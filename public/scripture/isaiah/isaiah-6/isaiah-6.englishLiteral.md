In-year-of death-of the-king, He_my_Strength (Uzziah).

And-I-saw ↳ my-Lord sitting over throne, high and-lifted_up, and-his-garments, filling ↳ the-temple. 
Burning_ones were-standing from-above to-him; six wings to-one, in-two he-covers his-face, and-in-two he-covers his-feet, and-in-two he-flies.

And-called_out this to this, and-said, 

"Holy, holy, holy, He_Who_Is of-Hosts,
fullness-of all the-land: his-glory."

And-shook pillars the-thresholds from-voice the-caller, and-the-house was-filled smoke.

And-I-said, "Woe- to-me for- I-am-silenced; for man unclean- lips, I, and-in-midst-of people- unclean lips I sit; for ↳ the-king, He_Who_Is of-Hosts have-seen my-eyes."


And-flew to-me one from the-burning_ones and-in-his-hand live_coal with-tongs he-took from-upon the-altar. 
And-he-touched to- my-mouth,
and-he-said, "Behold, has-touched this over- your-lips; and-turned_aside your-twisting, and-your-sin will-be-covered."
