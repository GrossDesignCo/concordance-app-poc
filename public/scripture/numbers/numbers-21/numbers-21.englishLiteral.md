And-sent, He_Who_Is, among-the-people ↳ the-snakes, the-burning_ones, and-they-struck ↳ the-people, and-died, people, many, from-Struggles_with_God (Israel).
And-came the-people to Draws_Out (Moses) and-they-said, "we-have-sinned, that we-have-spoken against-He_Who_Is and-against-you, pray to He_Who_Is, and-may-he-turn_aside from-over-us ↳ the-snake." 
And-prayed Draws_Out (Moses) on-behalf-of the-people.
And-said He_Who_Is to Draws_Out (Moses), "Make for-yourself burning_one, and-place it over standard, and-it-will-be, all the-struck, and-sees it, and-lives."

And-made, Draws_Out (Moses), snake, bronze, and-he-placed-it on the-standard, and-it-was, if struck the-snake ↳ man, and-he-looked to snake, the-bronze, and-lived.
