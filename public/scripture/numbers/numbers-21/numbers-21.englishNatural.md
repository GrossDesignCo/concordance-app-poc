And He-Who-Is (YHWH) sent the snakes, the burning-ones, among the people, 
and they struck the people; 
and many people of Struggles-with-God (Israel) died.

And the people came to Drawn-Out (Moses) 
and said, "We have sinned, that we have spoken against He-Who-Is (YHWH) 
and against you; pray to He-Who-Is (YHWH), 
and may he turn-aside the snake from over us." 
And Drawn-Out (Moses) prayed in unto the people.

And He-Who-Is (YHWH) said to Drawn-Out (Moses), 
"Make for yourself a burning-one, 
and place it over a standard; 
and it shall come about, everyone who is struck, 
and sees it, will live."

And Drawn-Out (Moses) made a bronze snake, 
and he placed it on the standard; 
and it came about, if the snake struck a man, 
and he looked to the bronze snake, he lived.
