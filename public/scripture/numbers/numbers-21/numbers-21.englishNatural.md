And He-Who-Is sent the snakes, the burning-ones, among the people, and they struck the people; and many people of Struggles-with-God (Israel) died.
And the people came to Draws-Out (Moses) and said, "We have sinned, that we have spoken against He-Who-Is and against you; pray to He-Who-Is, and may he turn-aside the snake from over us." 
And Draws-Out (Moses) prayed on behalf of the people.
And He-Who-Is said to Draws-Out (Moses), "Make for yourself a burning-one, and place it over a standard; and it shall come about, everyone who is struck, and sees it, will live."

And Draws-Out (Moses) made a bronze snake, and he placed it on the standard; and it came about, if the snake struck a man, and he looked to the bronze snake, he lived.
