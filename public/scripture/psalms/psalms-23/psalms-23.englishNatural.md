He-Who-Is (YHWH), my shepherd;
I will lack not.

in pastures of tender-shoot, he lies-me-down; 
over water of rest-place, he leads me.

my throat, he returns; 
in paths of righteousness, he guides me, 
for the sake of his name.

Also that I walk in a valley of shadow-death, I fear not bad;
that you are with me;
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

you prepare to my face a table, in the presence of my enemies;
you anoint with oil my head,
my cup, overflowing.

Only good and steadfast-love will pursue me, all the days of my life;
and I will sit in the house of He-Who-Is (YHWH), to the length of days.
