He_Who_Is, my-shepherd;
not I-will-lack.

in-pastures-of tender_shoot, he-causes-me-to-lie-down; 
over- water-of rest_place, he-leads-me.

my-throat, he-restores; 
in-paths-of- righteousness, he-guides-me, 
for-sake-of his-name.

Also that- I-walk in-valley-of shadow_death, not- I-fear bad;
that- you with-me;
your-rod and-your-staff, they comfort-me.

you-prepare to-my-face table, in-presence-of my-enemies;
you-anoint with-oil my-head,
my-cup, overflowing.

Only good and-steadfast_love they-will-pursue-me, all- days-of my-life;
and-I-will-sit in-house-of He_Who_Is, to-length-of days.
