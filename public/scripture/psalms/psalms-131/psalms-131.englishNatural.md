A Song of The Overs.
To David.

He-Who-Is, my heart is tall not, 
and my eyes are high not,
and I have walked not,
in greats and in wonders from me.

If not, I have balanced and I have silenced my throat;
as a weaned-one upon his mother,
as a weaned-one upon my throat.

Hope, Struggles-with-God (Israel) to He-Who-Is,
from now and on-behalf-of the-age.
